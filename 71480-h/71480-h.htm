<h2 class="large letter-spaced02"><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_v">[v]</span>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">In</span> Africa the centre of
interest shifts quickly, from Khartoum to the Cape, from the Congo
to Morocco. Before now it has lain in Abyssinia, for Englishmen
especially. It may be found there again. If so, the theatre of
action will probably be the little known region of Western
Abyssinia, and that district of the Anglo-Egyptian Nile Province
which adjoins it.</p>

<p>Geographically, Western Abyssinia dominates the south-east of
the Soudan. The Soudan, as every one in England knows now, is not a
continuation of the Desert of Sahara, but a land that once flowed
with milk and honey, and may again. It contains vast tracts of soil
perfectly adapted for the cultivation of cotton. A hostile force
descending from Abyssinia has the enormous advantage of moving from
difficult into easy country with an open line of retreat into
almost inaccessible mountains. An expedition from the Soudan, on
the other hand, would be confronted, after traversing miles of
uninhabited hilly wastes, by the necessity of forcing its way up
mule-paths winding among precipices.</p>

<p>There is no reason why peace should not be permanently
established between Egypt and Ethiopia, if the Abyssinian
slave-raids are stopped. But the changes and chances of
international politics bring about strange<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_vi">[vi]</span> consequences. Rumours, not without
foundation, have been circulated recently of new engagements
entered into by the Negus giving far-reaching concessions to
Americans. Other Powers are busy, and a diplomatic—and
spectacular—mission started lately from Berlin for Addis Abbiba.
There is room in the country for all nations to find commercial
opportunities. But if influences hostile to Great Britain became
dominant in Western Abyssinia, a danger to the Soudan—and not to
the Soudan only—would have arisen, the seriousness of which few
people at home, perhaps, rightly realize. I make no further apology
for bringing some account of a journey from Khartoum to Lake Tsana
before the public.</p>

<p>My heartiest thanks are due to my friend, Mr. Godfrey Burchett,
without whose aid in preparing for publication the rough notes of a
traveller’s diary, this book would not have come into existence. I
cannot too cordially acknowledge my indebtedness to him.</p>

<p>I wish to acknowledge also my great obligation to Sir W.
Garstin, who, on behalf of the Egyptian Government, has allowed me
to reproduce the map of Lake Tsana, published in his Report on the
Basin of the Upper Nile (1904); to Professor Poulton for his
kindness in preparing the entomological appendix to this volume;
and to Mr. C. E. Dupuis for permission to publish interesting
photographs taken by him. And I have the pleasure of cordially
thanking Mr. John Murray for leave given me to make extracts from
“Life in Abyssinia,” by Mansfield Parkyns, and the “Narrative of
the British Mission to Theodore, King of Abyssinia,” by<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span> Hormuzd Rassam; Messrs.
Macmillan and Co., for similar permission in the case of “The Nile
Tributaries of Abyssinia,” by Sir Samuel Baker; Messrs. C. Arthur
Pearson, Ltd., in the case of “Abyssinia,” by Herbert Vivian;
Messrs. Chapman & Hall in the case of “A Narrative of a Journey
through Abyssinia,” by Henry Dufton; and Mr. Augustus Wylde in the
case of “Modern Abyssinia.” It would have been impossible to
publish the collated information about the Soudan and Abyssinia
contained in this volume without the privilege kindly granted me by
these gentlemen.</p>

<h2 class="nopb"><a id="c01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">In</span> October, 1902, I was
acting as Medical Inspector of the native quarter of Alexandria.
Cholera had kept the staff busy, and we had brought the number of
cases down to about fifteen in the last days of the month. I had
passed the disinfecting gangs in review one morning before sending
them to their allotted quarters of the town, and had just resumed
my work in the hospital, when I heard a voice sing out to
me—without preliminary—“Hayes, would you like to go to
Abyssinia?”</p>

<p>It was the Chief Inspector of the Sanitary Department who asked
the question. By the evening I had made up my mind, and told him
that I should be glad to take the chance. However, I heard nothing
more of the matter till the middle of November. Then I received a
telegram directing me to make my preparations in Cairo. And I had
no time to waste; for I learned that the expedition to which I was
attached would start in seven days. The “jumping-off place” would
be close to Khartoum.</p>

<p>Twenty years earlier the journey thither would have had a
lingering fascination of romance. Ten years earlier it would
probably have brought the traveller by painful<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_2">[2]</span> paths to the Land of No Return. To-day it
lies within the range of the prudent tourist who prefers safe
adventures between regular meals. He is much indebted to Lord
Kitchener.</p>

<p>In Cairo I joined my companions Mr. Dupuis and Mr. Crawley. They
had had arrangements for the expedition in hand for many months;
indeed, it had been planned for the previous year, but the illness
of Sir William Garstin at Khartoum delayed it. On November 27 we
reached Assouan. Like hundreds of my fellow-countrymen, I
photographed the great dam, and the temple of Philæ. Our next stage
was by post-boat to Wady Halfa, where we arrived on December 1. In
the evening of that day we took train on the Soudan Government
Railway. The following morning I had a new experience; for I had
never before seen the mirage from the window of a railway
carriage.</p>

<p>The granite rocks seemed to rise out of a great lake. The
illusion was so perfect that I used it as a test of my black
“boy’s” shrewdness. I called him, and said, “Look at the water!”
His answer was, “It is not the water. It is the water-thief, your
excellency.”</p>

<p>In this desolate land, with a burning sky over it, there are no
trees. It is all of a piece, and the different parts of it give no
sense of varied locality. The stations are not named but numbered,
and here the water is stored in zinc tanks. Command of the tanks
means command of the country—an important fact in connection with
possible <i>émeutes</i> of native troops.</p>

<p>At Abou Hamed we reached the Nile again, and saw vegetation.
Warm baths are provided in the station. We jumped out of the train
in our pyjamas and rushed into luxury.</p>

<p>The railway follows the river to Helfiah, on the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> opposite side of the river to
Khartoum. Here I first beheld our camels, the steadily stubborn
source of infinite vexation. All that is hard and heart-breaking in
the character of the desert is incarnate in the camel. At Helfiah
we engaged Soudanese “boys,” settled matters with officials, and
finished our preparations for shooting big game.</p>

<p>I went to the Soudan Club at Khartoum, and strolled about the
town in the spirit of an inquiring tourist. It is carefully
administered, and is laid out in three sections. The best houses
are being built by the riverbank. Plans of these must be submitted
for approval. They are mostly of red brick, and well constructed.
Smaller houses, the “second class,” have their sites behind the big
residences. The “third-class” district is still further back. The
object of this caste system applied to builders’ enterprise is to
secure that there shall be a fine promenade along the river front,
and no mean streets near to it. The British and Egyptian flags are
hoisted side by side over the quarters of the army of occupation.
The Gordon College—the other tribute to the man’s work—is a big,
square, red-brick building. It seems to insist on its resemblance
to barracks. No dahabeahs are seen on the Nile here; the boats are
feluccas. Having made these notes of a tripper I returned to
Helfiah. This was on December 5.</p>

<p>We dined in our camp, and slept in our tents for the first time,
and I ceased to be a tourist, and became a member of an expedition.
My companions and I showed the servants how to pitch the tents and
peg them, and we apportioned loads to the camels. The camel is—not
metaphorically—foul-mouthed. We put some of the boys up to try the
paces of the animals, trusting chiefly to one who had served in the
Camel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> Corps under
Kitchener. I watched the exhibition of ungainly shuffling with the
face of one who judges, but I thought of the hours during which I
should be shaken under the glaring sun.</p>

<p>Next morning we were up at sunrise. We had not yet lost touch of
the British breakfast-table, for we ate sausages and poached eggs.
Then the camels were loaded and the tents were struck, and at
mid-day we started—three Englishmen, six native servants, forty
camels, and ten camel-men. Our route lay along the north bank of
the Blue Nile, over a beaten track in a wilderness of loose sand. A
few scattered thorny mimosa bushes are the only vegetation. I timed
the camels and found they travelled about 3¼ miles an hour. At two
o’clock the temperature was 104° F. in the shade, but all the
surroundings were new to me, and I enjoyed the journey in spite of
the monotony of the country. It is all bare desert, and one never
loses sight of the mirage. At one point I watched a flock of goats,
which looked exactly as if they were knee deep in water. We reached
Soba, fourteen miles up the river, at sundown. Here there is a
pleasant and clean little rest-house built of straw. We had kept
ahead of our baggage-train, which arrived an hour later. People in
England who speak of tea as refreshing do not know the full meaning
of that word. The cups were filled for men who had fasted since
breakfast at 7.30, except for a welcome drink of river water on
arrival, and were served with biscuits and sardines. After this,
the happiness of a wash, and an eight o’clock dinner. A meal of
curry and rice and tinned roast beef is not a severe hardship, and
the only <i>contretemps</i> on our first day in the desert was the
discovery that we must put ourselves on short rations of candles.
A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> mistake had been made
about the quantity ordered, and we were ill supplied. But there was
a clear moon. We turned in to sleep in the open, and the sandflies
found us and were glad; for we were fresh blood, and they were
small enough to crawl through the meshes of the mosquito
curtains.</p>

<p>The first signs of dawn brought us out of bed next morning. We
were in good luck; for the servants had kept a fire alight all
night, and hot water was ready for us. There was beatitude in a
warm bath after the plague of sandflies. We started at daybreak;
there was no change in the track or the country. Heat, a high wind
and dust spoiled the journey in the morning. We halted to lunch
under the largest mimosa bush we could find, which gave as much
shade as a telegraph pole.</p>

<p>Crawley opened his big artist’s umbrella, which should have been
a successful aid to comfort, but it tried conclusions with the wind
and was worsted. We started again at two o’clock, and arrived in
the evening at our camping-ground opposite the pleasant village of
Sheik-el-Obeid. Our guns played the part of poulterer for us and
varied our diet. In the morning Dupuis had shot a brace of
sand-grouse, and in the khor<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> below our camp I had the
luck to bag a teal. The temperature fell rapidly after sundown, and
the night was very cold. The mosquitoes were numbed and did not
stir, but the camels did, and I found them as effective in
promoting a vigil. All night long they were browsing on the mimosa
scrub; they relish the thorns, which are about two inches long. I
heard them pull the branches, and then, when one was released, it
recoiled into place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
with a swish. There was a continuous noise of this movement, and it
vaguely reminded me of breaking water.</p>

<p>The camels were hobbled, and stumbled from bush to bush. I
constantly expected that one would stumble upon my bed. They loomed
up, shadowy and grotesque, in the light of the bearers’ fires, and
I had a kind of nightmare of them without sleep.</p>

<p>On the 8th we were up before sunrise. Probably the camels, after
supping all night, were tired. I say “probably”; for the camel is
an aberrant type, and one can only guess its sensations. They were
unwilling to barak<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to receive their loads, and were grunting,
snarling, and growling. When one of these beasts seems likely to
become unmanageable, the camel-man “bridles” it by passing his
index finger through the orifice between its nostrils. In breaking
in young ones, a stout thorn, shaped as a peg, is used in the same
position.</p>

<p>We started at 7.30, and walked ahead of the baggage train with
our guns. At nine o’clock, when the sun had gained power, we took
to the saddle. The country through which we passed is cultivated
during the rainy season; it is scored with ravines, hollowed out by
the rush of water in the wet months, and is uncomfortable ground
for travellers.</p>

<p>During the day we shot five pigeons and a sand-grouse. Beside
the river we saw and heard great numbers of demoiselle cranes, but
found it impossible to get within gun-range of them. They have
scouts on the watch both when they are in flight and when they
settle, and as soon as the warning cry is given by the outpost the
shooter’s chance is gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>We reached our
camping-ground, near Bushagra, before five o’clock, and pitched one
tent for our own use in case a dust storm should come upon us. I
bathed on the brink of the river, but kept out of the pool for fear
of crocodiles. As yet I had seen none, but I made their
acquaintance quite closely enough later in the journey. The night
was warm, and we slept in the open on the bank of the Nile.</p>

<p>I began the next day (December 9) with a lucky shot. I had put
my gun and a No. 3 cartridge—the only one I had—on the table near
my bed before turning in, as I hoped that the demoiselles might be
less cautious before daybreak. I was up an hour before dawn, and
loaded my gun. I could hear the croaking of the birds for a long
distance, and knew from the sound that they were moving. Just at
the moment when I was ready, three cranes sailed over the camp.
They were within range; and when I fired, a fine demoiselle
collapsed and came to the ground in a heap. These birds make good
eating.</p>

<p>All the country in this district has the same character. The low
mimosa scrub is varied by patches of land which are cultivated in
the rainy season. The Khalifa had his powder and cartridge factory
at Bushagra, and possibly the natives thought that European
vengeance might fall on them for this reason. In any case the
Soudanese here showed nervousness, and made off when they saw us
coming.</p>

<p>We ate another British breakfast—porridge and sausages—and then
started on foot with our guns at half-past seven. A tramp of five
miles gave us no sport, and we mounted our camels about nine
o’clock. Our road lay through the hottest country I have ever
known, and the temperature rose hourly as the day<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> advanced. Smoked glasses ease the
eyes a little, and there is shade under one’s white umbrella, but
nothing seems able to allay the thirst which this land causes. It
is a mistake to suppose that one must go east of Suez to gain
experience of true human drought. The water in my bottle<a id=
"FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
lasted, and only just lasted, through the journey.</p>

<p>Hot, parched men, in a hot, uninteresting land, are not likely
to be in their best temper, and we had to bear with our guide. He
had asserted that he knew the whole country, but he barely knew how
to follow the track, and seemed to lack ideas of time and distance.
We asked him, “When shall we reach the river again?” He pointed to
a large section of the heavens and answered, “When the sun reaches
there.” He could not tell us the names of villages which lay on our
route, and our maps were not trustworthy.</p>

<p>We reached the river bank after our halt at lunch-time, but left
it again, and my camel’s action appeared to be more back-breaking
and monotonous than ever. Two hours in the saddle seemed like four,
and Xenophon’s Greeks were not more delighted to behold the sea
than I was by the sight of the blue water as we approached it late
in the afternoon. Our camping ground was beside the stream, and I
rushed to the brink with my enamelled mug; the water was rather
muddy, but the draught seemed like nectar.</p>

<p>I tried for a fish, without success. When I returned to camp I
heard a camel grunting loudly and dismally. On going to discover
the cause, I found the animal fastened to the ground by cords,
while a man was scarifying its<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_9">[9]</span> back with live cinders. The object is to
produce counter-irritation as a remedy for cysts. I arrived too
late to deliver the unhappy beast from the horrors of Soudanese
veterinary treatment, as the operation had just been completed.
However, I gave the Arabs “a piece of my mind.” They may not have
understood my Arabic, but they could not mistake the meaning.</p>

<p>We had covered twenty miles during the day and camped beside a
khor, opposite to a village called Baranku, which is situated on an
island in the river.</p>

<p>On the following morning we started with our guns and walked
ahead of the camels. Besides pigeons, we shot plovers of two kinds
which I had not seen before. Our route throughout the day was over
fertile soil, perfectly adapted for the cultivation of cotton. At
present, grain (durrha) is grown here, and apparently only one crop
is raised annually, after the summer rains. But Dupuis told me that
if a canal were cut and a system of irrigation established the soil
would bear “the kindly fruits of the earth” all the year round.
Villages are numerous in this district, and we never lost sight of
one or other of them during our day’s journey. I noticed a great
disproportion between the numbers of male and female inhabitants.
In a hamlet in which I made inquiry there were eighteen women to
one man. Nearly all the men had perished in the days of the Mahdi
and Osman Digna. As a consequence, the women worked in the fields,
while their few surviving consorts led lives of idleness. I suppose
they were considered, and considered themselves, too valuable to be
subjected to fatigue. They were too poor to buy tobacco, or smoking
might have kept them silent. As it was, when they were not asleep
they were talking, and I wondered how they could possibly find
topics for incessant conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>We halted for the
night on the bank of the river, two miles from Rufa’a, which is the
second largest town on the Blue Nile. Miralai<a id=
"FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Blewitt Bey, the Moudir<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of Rufa’a, sent a police officer with a
courteous message, expressing his desire to do all in his power to
assist us. A welcome gift of eggs and fresh milk reached us a few
hours later, and at the same time two night-watchmen (Gaffirs)
arrived for the protection of the camp. We were heartily grateful
for our countryman’s good-will. Dupuis dined with him that evening,
while Crawley and I remained in charge of the camp.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon I applied iodoform to the back of
one of the camels, to keep the flies from a sore. All the drivers
came clamouring to me after this, importuning me to treat every
scratch on the beasts of burden in the same way. One wishes to
conform to the tradition of ready helpfulness which is, happily,
associated with the medical profession, but I declined to become
physician in ordinary to the forty camels, as far as abrasions were
concerned.</p>

<p>Next morning our troublesome guide sought me out to complain of
symptoms of dyspepsia. He remarked that he was incessantly
spitting—a circumstance which I had already noticed with disgust. I
told him that if he swallowed the water which Allah gave him in his
mouth, it would make his food move from the place where he had the
pain, which was a punishment from Providence for his wastefulness.
He asked many questions to make sure that I knew what I was talking
about, and then left me, much impressed. My “prescription” had the
desired effect, and he gave up his objectionable habit.</p>

<p>The morning of December 11 was very cold for<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> these low latitudes. Just before
sunrise the thermometer sank to 43° F. When we were ready to start,
we found that the head baggage-man was drunk. He had been tippling
“marissa,” which the villagers brew from fermented barley. The man
leered vacantly and was incapable of work. Considering the thirst
and the opportunities there was little drunkenness among our boys
in the Soudan, and we had no further trouble from this source. But
the precepts of the Prophet did not keep those who accompanied us
into Abyssinia from the vile beer of the country.</p>

<p>Blewitt Bey, on his pony, met us just after we had mounted our
camels, and rode five miles with us. He gave us most valuable
information about the land in which our road lay, and we were sorry
when he said good-bye with best of wishes for our success.</p>

<p>We were in the saddle nearly eight hours and travelled about
twenty-three miles. We reached our camping-ground at Abou Harras at
five o’clock. The sun set almost immediately, and we, who were in
advance, pitched our three tents by moonlight. The last of the
baggage train did not arrive till an hour and a half later, and the
drunken “Sheik of the Afsh”<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was not with it.</p>

<p>The country through which we passed was similar to that which we
had seen on the previous day. It is perfectly fertile. We had left
the sand and mimosa scrub behind us, and were in a well-wooded
region, with abundant undergrowth of bushes. The open ground is
covered by grass which grows to a height of nine feet in the rainy
season, but was now dried and matted under foot. It supplies
pasturage for cattle, and I saw a herd of kine grazing on it. They
were in fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
condition. I handed my mug to the herdsman and asked him for some
milk. He gave it to me willingly, and I thought it the best I had
tasted since I left England in 1899. It seemed to me that this
district offered a valuable field to British capital and
enterprise.</p>

<p>I extract from my diary the following unsystematic notes, with
an apology to the reader:—The butterflies which I saw most
frequently on the journey were the clouded yellow and the red tip.
The brimstone and painted yellow are seen occasionally. The
familiar cabbage white is found on the banks of the river. I heard
no singing bird except the chaffinch, but I saw a pair of
blackbirds, tits of many kinds, and fly-catchers. A long-tailed
species, which is a little smaller than a ring-dove, is very
common. It was called “albicora” by our black boys.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span><a id=

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">We</span> did not expect to
receive a public welcome at Abou Harras, and were thoroughly
surprised when the entire village, on the morning of the 12th,
turned out to give us a reception. Women and men bore down on us,
dancing and clapping their hands to a hideous accompaniment of
tomtoms and drums. Many of them leaped and capered in the craziest
fashion to emphasize the display of pleasure at our arrival. The
women and children expressed their delight by a peculiar tremolo
cry, which reminded me of that heard in Lower Egypt at marriage
festivals.<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a> One old man came on at a leisurely pace giving
an exhibition of sword-play in our honour. He afterwards delivered
a panegyric of the English, declaring that they were the saviours
of his country, that the children of the Soudanese were now no
longer torn from them, and so forth. I found that the young men
were almost all absent from the village, doing military service on
the Abyssinian frontier; the women who came out to show their
delight officially by their shrilling were “the girls they left
behind them.” This singular deputation<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_14">[14]</span> had not approached very near, and presently
retired a little way. Some of the slower movements of those who
took part in the ceremony were by no means ungraceful, but the din
was indescribably discordant. I went to inspect the procession at
close quarters, supposing that it would shortly withdraw and
disperse. But the “music” continued for fully an hour and a half,
and it was more difficult to endure patiently during the latter
part of the time as we were all busily writing letters for the
homeward mail. A messenger had to carry them half a dozen miles and
return immediately to rejoin, and he was waiting for our
correspondence.</p>

<p>The point of junction of the river Rahad with the Blue Nile is
half a mile distant from Abou Harras, and my companions walked to
the spot later in the day. I attended to some odd jobs of the kind
which a traveller always finds he has in arrear, and then I tried
for fish, but caught nothing and lost my spinner. Many herons had
taken their station on a strip of sand about a hundred yards from
the place where I stood, and paid no heed to my presence.</p>

<p>On this day we had the good luck to receive two English
visitors. The first was Mr. Wilson, the Moudir of Wad-el-Medani. We
could only offer him a cup of rather muddy tea; but the village
offered him the public reception, and the music was as loud as ever
at the second performance. Our second guest was Bimbashi Gwynn, who
landed from the sternwheeler which had left Khartoum on the 10th.
He was on the way to Abyssinia to settle the boundary question. He
had been in that country before, and as he was able to stay and
dine with us, we had the benefit of many useful hints in the course
of a pleasant chat in the evening.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>At Abou Harras we
parted company with our guide, drivers, and forty camels. There was
no unhappiness at the leave-taking. We inspected the men and
animals that we had hired in their place, and devoutly hoped we had
made a better choice.</p>

<p>On the following morning the thermometer again sank to 43
degrees, and the atmosphere and the water seemed bitterly cold to
us. We started on the road to Gedaref just before nine o’clock. Our
new guide was a Greek, who had made the journey many times, and was
said to know everything that need be known. I was sceptical.</p>

<p>Our route followed the course of the telegraph, and lay at first
beside the Rahad. This river differs considerably in the dry season
from the Blue Nile. In the latter we had found a fairly fast
current flowing over a stony or sandy bed between banks composed of
mud. The stream passed through a succession of shallows and deep
pools. The Rahad, at the point of junction with the Nile, was
entirely dry, and we proceeded some distance up the course before
we found pools. The banks are high and steep.</p>

<p>I do not think that Sir Samuel Baker at all exaggerated the
fertility and value of the land in this region. He wrote: “The
entire country would be a mine of wealth were it planted with
cotton.”<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class=
"fnanchor">[8]</a> The Rahad, as he said, “flows through rich
alluvial soil; the country is a vast level plain, with so trifling
a fall that the current of the river is gentle.”<a id=
"FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
This circumstance would facilitate irrigation. Besides mimosa trees
and much other timber, we found in this region matted growths of
bushes and wide stretches of long<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_16">[16]</span> grass now tangled on the ground—all bearing
testimony to the quality of the soil.</p>

<p>I soon perceived that my hope of a better mount was vain. My new
camel was a failure from the start. His paces were indescribable,
and when he trotted I felt like a bad sailor in a small boat on a
lively sea. In an hour’s time I had lost my temper and got rid of
the camel. As the result, I was better served, and a beast was
brought for me which shambled evenly, and allowed me to keep up
with my companions.</p>

<p>We halted for lunch at a village called Hadeiba, where two
sheikhs came out to receive us. They were very polite, but would
neither eat nor smoke, as we were in the month of Ramadan.
By-and-by they remembered that they ought to give us a present, and
left us, saying that they would bring two sheep, according to the
custom of the Soudan. Half an hour later we quitted the spot.</p>

<p>That night we camped at a place named Khor Abou Segeira, close
to the Rahad. Near at hand was a muddy pool in the course of the
river, and we had to draw our supply of liquor from it. As usual,
we set our Berkfeld filters to work. A candle is a part of the
apparatus through which the water filters, and we found that this
incessantly became foul and required to be cleaned every three
minutes. However, we replenished our stock of clear water
sufficiently, and then went to bed by moonlight in the open.</p>

<p>We started at a quarter-past seven on the morning of the 14th.
No tents had been pitched the night before, so none had to be
struck, and our departure was earlier on this account. My
companions and I took our guns into the bushy ground beside the
river while the camels followed the track towards Gedaref. We were
in search<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> of
guinea-fowl, which are found in great abundance on the banks of the
Rahad. These birds run in flocks, and rise at about forty yards’
distance when one tries to approach them.</p>

<p>I lost sight of my companions in the thick, tangled vegetation,
and after waiting where I was for a while in case they should
chance to rejoin me, roamed on. I found no guinea-fowl, but pigeons
and ringdoves were in great abundance, and there were hoopoes,
hornbills, kingfishers, and numbers of other birds. A little later
I came to the banks of the river. Here I saw a company of grivet
monkeys. These, according to Mansfield Parkyns, are called “tota”
or “waag” in Abyssinia. He described the species as “a beautiful
little greenish-grey monkey, with black face and white
whiskers.”<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a> The natty little fellows whom I met by the
Rahad just answered the description. They were clean and sleek, and
looked as “spry” as cleverness could make them.</p>

<p>After following the course of the river for about half a mile I
made towards the track and found it without difficulty, but I saw
no sign of our baggage-train. However, one of our boys trotted up a
few minutes later, and then I learned that the camels were some way
behind. In fact, an hour and a half passed before they overtook me.
When the others came up, I learned that they had supposed me to be
lost and had scoured the country in all directions, and that the
whole party had been detained till all the searchers were called
in. I was intensely annoyed to find that I had been the cause of
the needless delay.</p>

<p>We lunched beside another muddy pool in the course of the Rahad,
and then moved forward to our camping-ground for the night, which
was called Mesr-el-Ashir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>During the journey
we had noticed that our escort were driving two sheep. We made
inquiry about them, and were told that they had been purchased by
the Greek guide on the previous day. We had a very strong suspicion
that they were the animals which the Sheikhs had promised us at
Hadeiba, and that the subtle Hellene had benefited by the gift. One
of the sheep was killed in the evening, and we received “a present”
of a leg, some chops, and a couple of kidneys. The meat was
excellent.</p>

<p>Our route now left the course of the Rahad, and we turned
eastward towards Gedaref.</p>

<p>Our beds were spread in the open again. Orion was straight above
me as I lay, before falling asleep, and Sirius nearer to the
southern horizon. I looked for the constellation and the star each
night when I turned in, and had a sense of being in the presence of
old friends while I gazed at them.</p>

<p>On the following morning, December 15, I again changed my mount
for the better, and rode a smoothly trotting camel at last. Our
day’s journey was a short one, and brought us to the last
watering-place which a traveller on this road reaches before the
wells of Fau. On the way my companions shot a couple of
guinea-fowl, and we were glad to see them at dinner-time.</p>

<p>We camped at night close to a long range of hills of a granite
formation called Gebal Arang. They rise to a height of three
hundred or four hundred feet, and make a striking change in the
landscape as one approaches them. I knew that our Berbereen boys
had never seen such high ground, and watched them to observe what
impression it made upon them. It made none. They are an apathetic
race, philosophers of the <i>nil admirari</i> school by
temperament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>On these inland
marches we carried water in tanks, and were obliged to hoard it. We
had to go back in the morning to the allowance which had served us
for washing purposes overnight. In all this region, every condition
of life, important and unimportant, depends upon the rivers. At
Gebel Arang we saw gazelles and the antelopes called ariels for the
first time. We also caught sight of a large bustard, and my
companion stalked it unsuccessfully. It is hard work to carry a gun
in a hot country where every bush, and even the grass, grows thorns
that “mean business,” and the man who fails is usually weary as
well as disappointed.</p>

<p>Next day, December 16, we travelled at the foot of the hills. It
was a pleasant journey, for there was verdure, and the tall mimosas
threw shade on the track. Besides the flocks of guinea-fowl to
which we were accustomed, we saw a hare—the first we had found in
the Soudan. Before midday we reached the wells of Fau. The
drinking-water here is of a fairly good quality, but not quite free
from mud. Guinea-fowl again supplied our dinner. They are slow to
rise, but not easy to shoot; for they run in the most nimble
fashion among the thick covert, and to come within range, the
“guns” have to run too. The sun is strong overhead, the thorns are
strong all round, and the exercise is smart work, even for a man in
sound condition.</p>

<p>In the evening a messenger from the Intelligence Department
reached our camp. He brought us letters and papers, and I
ascertained that he, on a fast camel and without baggage, had
travelled in two and a half days a distance which we had covered in
six.</p>

<p>Our halting-place was between two ranges of the hills. The wind
blew hard during the night, and the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_20">[20]</span> current of it came racing down the valley
where we lay. Great clouds of dust were carried with it, and the
particles were driven thickly into every crevice and corner.
Crawley and I tried to form a shelter by piling up our square boxes
behind us, but this was of little avail. It was an excitement of a
sort, but not pleasant to a sleepy man.</p>

<p>We lay later than usual next morning, December 17, as we did not
intend to strike our camp till midday. My companions went to shoot
the poultry, and I remained in my tent and nearly shot myself
without expending a cartridge. Our plan for securing fizzing drinks
was to put a sparklet in a bottle of water and screw in the top. I
was busy upon this operation when the bottle which I was handling
burst. As luck would have it, I received no injury, though I was
peppered with fragments of glass. One particle entered the eye of
my boy Achmet. I extracted it and found that no serious damage had
been done to the organ. After this, we abandoned the use of
sparklets, and fizzing drinks were things of the “dear, dead past,”
and the uncertain future.</p>

<p>We left the camp at midday, after six guinea-fowl had been
brought in, and struck into the waterless country between our
halting-place and Gedaref. The distance is seventy-two miles. We
were obliged to carry the drinking supply for the whole journey.
Our route lay along a good track that follows the line of the
telegraph.</p>

<p>The soil in this region is soft, friable earth, perfectly
adapted for cotton cultivation. But the district is unhealthy in
the rainy season, when malaria prevails and the country is a
reeking swamp of dead and living vegetation. It was perfectly dry
when we traversed it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
and we ran no risk of disease. The tangle of desiccated tall grass
lay upon the ground, as in so many tracts of this part of the
Soudan, and our road was bordered by mimosa shrubs. They grow
thickly in places, but were not high enough to give protection from
the sun.</p>

<p>We halted for the night at five o’clock, and unpacked only our
beds and such things as were strictly necessary, for we were to
start at half-past four next morning.</p>

<p>I was very sleepy when I was roused at 3.30 a.m. on the 18th. We
had a cup of cocoa, and then left our camping-ground at the
appointed time by moonlight. The air was chilly even after the sun
rose at six o’clock, and the warmth of the day did not make itself
felt before eight. At half-past ten we halted for a <i>déjeuner à
la fourchette</i>, and rested for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen by the time we reached our camping-ground at
the place called Terras Wad-el-Fau. We had covered thirty-two miles
of our journey since the morning. At this spot we rejoiced to find
that an Egyptian soldier in charge of two <i>fantasses</i>
(watertanks) had been sent to meet us by the Inspector of Gedaref.
Our camel-men with the baggage were some distance behind us, and we
lighted a bonfire of mimosa wood to cheer them forward. They
overtook us at their leisure, and our dinner of stewed guinea-fowl
was not served till a quarter to ten.</p>

<p>We were out of bed by five o’clock next morning, December 19,
and hastened the preparations for the start. We had to cover thirty
miles in order to reach Gedaref in the evening. All this country—I
cannot call it desert, though the conditions are not dissimilar—is
comfortless for travellers, but our last day’s journey in it was
the worst. The heat was intense; so much so that “resting” at
lunch-time seemed less tolerable<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_22">[22]</span> than movement on camel-back. To quench an
incessant thirst we had only the water stored in our tanks, which
was warm and far from colourless. Even the hint of shade given by
the mimosa scrub had now disappeared, and our eyes were wearied by
the monotonous stretches of land, in which nothing was seen but the
dried and matted grass. It had been fired in places, accidentally I
think; for though it is often kindled to clear the ground for
crops, in this region there was no trace of agriculture. The flames
had a ghostly, exhausted, unreal look in the burning sunshine.
After a march that seemed interminable we beheld, from rising
ground, three trees with verdure on them, and then we knew that we
were near the boundary of this distressing district. A two miles’
journey brought us to the house of Mr. Flemming at Gedaref<a id=
"FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a>—a square building made of sun-dried mud. At our
countryman’s dwelling a warm welcome and cool drinks awaited us.
Here we found Bimbashis Gwynn and Liddell. That evening Mr.
Flemming gave us our Christmas dinner—and we reconciled ourselves
to antedating it—with true British plum-pudding in the
<i>menu</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span><a id=
"c03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">I had</span> slept in the open by
choice and felt it a luxury to awake on the following morning with
no prospect of a fatiguing journey. At seven o’clock on December 20
we met again at Mr. Flemming’s house, and busied ourselves with
amateur photography.</p>

<p>“You are the last white men I shall see until June next year,”
said our host, “so I want to keep your faces.”</p>

<p>After breakfast we proceeded to the selection of seventeen
“boys,” who were to go up with our donkeys from Gallabat to
Abyssinia. The character of the country beyond the frontier of the
Soudan renders transit by camel impossible. It struck me as an
interesting fact, not without a bearing upon the doctrine of
Evolution, that the change from a flat or undulating to a
mountainous region is here accompanied not only by a variation in
the means of access, in the climate, in the flora and fauna, but in
the race of inhabitants and the creed which they profess. In fact,
the highlands of Abyssinia may be said to constitute “an island on
the land,” if one may borrow the phrase which Darwin applied to the
peaks of the Andes. And a similar peculiarity in the survival of
types can be observed here as that to which the great biologist
referred in the other connection.</p>

<p>Mansfield Parkyns pointed out that the Abyssinians<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> were, in his time, poor
swordsmen, ridiculous in their practice of musketry and frequently
wanting in genuine courage.<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Their country has
constantly been the scene of civil war and other dissensions.
Indeed the Jews among them, to whom I shall refer in another
chapter, at one time established a separate state in the “mountain
fastnesses of Semien and Belusa, where, under their own kings and
queens called Gideon and Judith, they<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_25">[25]</span> maintained till the beginning of the
seventeenth century a chequered and independent existence.”<a id=
"FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In spite of these hindrances and deficiencies the Abyssinian
people, government and creed, have survived among heights protected
on one side by the sea and on the other by a tract of country which
is uninhabitable and impassable from May to September, on account
of the incessant torrential rains and the floods which they cause.
If these favouring conditions had not existed, the Abyssinian
nation would long ago have been “converted” to Islamism or
exterminated, and in the former case they would have become
assimilated by consanguinity to, if not merged in, the surrounding
Arab and negroid tribes. As it is, the Abyssinians form,
ethnologically, an entirely distinct race.</p>

<p>This digression has carried me a long way from the “donkey-boys”
at Gedaref. They were paraded to the number of a hundred for our
inspection—Dongolis, Abyssinians, Tokrooris, Dinkas, Hadendowas,
men from every clan in the district. An uglier-looking crowd I
never beheld, and, as I gazed at the sinister, villainous faces, I
hoped rather than believed that our choice of seventeen would not
include robbers or murderers. We adopted the plan of choosing one
or two men from each of the different races. Experience showed that
the policy was sound, for no tribal quarrel was raised during our
journey in Abyssinia. None of the groups was strong enough to
commence a feud with confidence.</p>

<p>The business of selection was completed after the haggling and
confusion inseparable from a bargain among Orientals, and I spent
most of the remainder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
of this and the following day in acquainting myself with the
features of life in Gedaref. As this place is a type of the more
important towns in the Soudan, in which Great Britain has a
permanent interest, I hope the reader will tolerate the
transcription of a few of my notes.</p>

<p>The inhabitants number about eight thousand, and live—to use Mr.
Dufton’s description—“in a number of scattered villages, the
principal called Hellet-es-Sook, or the market town.”<a id=
"FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The dwellings in this part of the Soudan and in Abyssinia are of
the same construction, and I cannot better convey a conception of
their simplicity and their appearance to those of my readers who
have not seen them than by quoting the following passage from Mr.
Dufton’s work:—“Some of the houses are built of sun-dried bricks
and have flat roofs, but most of them” (almost all in Western
Abyssinia) “are conical thatched huts. The latter are made in the
following manner:—In the first place a circle of about twenty feet
diameter is described on the ground and surrounded by strong posts,
each a yard apart, which are interlaced with thin pliable branches
of trees, the whole being covered outwardly with durrha stalks,
tied together with the long grass common on the banks of the river.
A roof is formed in skeleton on the ground. A number of beams,
corresponding to that of the posts, are made to converge at the
top, and are held in this position by concentric circles of plaited
twigs; the whole being then raised to its position on the house,
where it is fastened and made ready to receive the thatch of straw
and grass. Not a nail or rivet of any kind is used in the
construction of these buildings, and they are rendered totally
impervious to the wet. Of course<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_27">[27]</span> their disadvantage in comparison with mud
houses is their liability to catch fire, one or two cases of which
I have witnessed; but they are generally built at sufficient
distance not to endanger others, and a house of this description is
rebuilt in a day or two.”<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Hence the scattered
appearance of the huts. They cover a distance some five miles in
length at Gedaref. These dwellings are called “tokhuls,” and I
shall have occasion to allude to them frequently under that name.
In the Soudan storks build their nests round the upper part of the
roofs, and are not molested.</p>

<p>In Mr. Dufton’s time an open-air market was held twice a week in
Gedaref. He thus describes it:—“One part is devoted to the sale of
camels, cattle, sheep, and goats; another to that of corn and
durrha; another milk and butter; another raw cotton, dates, etc.
The butcher slaughters his meat on the spot, whether ox, sheep, or
camel. The camel is killed somewhat differently from the rest; for
it may well be imagined that a camel with merely its throat cut
might be a long while in dying. They therefore adopt the mode of
striking it with a long knife at once to the heart, having
previously taken care to tie his long legs in a manner that he
cannot move.”<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class=
"fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The commerce of the place has been resuscitated since the
British and Egyptian occupation. The market is now held daily. In
addition there are the usual bazaars of an Oriental town. Gedaref
has the advantage of possessing wells from which water of good
quality is drawn. The place suffered severely in the time of the
Dervishes. They raided the district as often as their supplies ran
low, ruined the cultivation, and destroyed the greater part of the
habitations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>The people seemed
to be peaceable and contented under the present administration, and
I was struck by their politeness towards Europeans. As we passed,
they rose, if they were squatting on the ground; those riding
dismounted as a token of respect; those who were at work
discontinued it and stood still.</p>

<p>There are a certain number of shops in the town kept by Greeks.
The commerce of the Eastern Soudan is almost entirely in the hands
of Hellenes, who import goods by way of Suakim. The merchandise is
brought up the country by camel-train. The articles most in request
among the natives are cheap mirrors, tumblers, coloured silk
handkerchiefs and similar goods—in short, cheap finery and cheap
small commodities. I am not a commercial man, and do not speak upon
the point with certainty, but I think German houses meet this
demand. The Greek retailers also carry on a brisk trade in olives,
which are imported in barrels. Olives and bread are the staple of
the diet of many Soudanese, and they eat this simple food with
relish.</p>

<p>We found that we could purchase sugar, taken from the familiar
sugar-loaf, soap, similar sundries and tinned provisions at
Gedaref. I was pleased to observe—for my own sake and that of
British enterprise—that the latter bore the trade-mark of Messrs.
Crosse and Blackwell.</p>

<p>My impression with regard to commercial opportunities in these
towns is that a northern-bred storekeeper could not compete with
the Greek retailer. I do not refer, in making this inference,
especially to the singular astuteness of the latter. But it is an
important consideration that these men are able to live almost on
the same scale as the natives, and their profits are due to the
frugality of their life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>We managed to
start our baggage-train on the journey from Gedaref to Gallabat by
a quarter to eight on the morning of the 22nd December. Then we
breakfasted with Mr. Flemming, and mounted our camels to take the
road again at 9.15. We moved forward at a trot, and I, now making
trial of my fourth “steed,” found I had good luck for the second
time. But I do not think that any one could devote to the camel the
affection which is so readily given to a horse after a brief
acquaintance. The animal with the “sculptured sneer” does not
invite friendship. It grunts and grimaces when one mounts, and the
rider can be under no illusion as to its sentiment towards him.</p>

<p>We saw some ariel, and my companions gave chase and tried to get
within rifle-range. But the animals were shy and wary. The hunters
exhausted their supply of ammunition, but brought no game. We
lunched as usual in the scrappy shade of a mimosa bush, and reached
Shisana well shortly after four o’clock.</p>

<p>We had now left the “cotton soil” region, and entered an
undulating country, where our road lay over rocky or stony ground.
The character of the vegetation changed, and we began to pass
through glades of the great mimosa forest which extends from the
neighbourhood of Gedaref almost to Gallabat. Here the mimosas are
not bushes but trees, and it is from them that the gum-arabic is
collected which gives Gedaref its highly valuable trade and its
prosperity. Large quantities of the gum are exported by way of
Suakim, and there is a market for it at Cairo and other towns of
Lower Egypt. For instance, much crape is manufactured in Damietta,
where I have watched the process. Gum from Gedaref is used to
stiffen the texture, and serves the same purpose in the preparation
of various silken fabrics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>The industry might
be largely developed. At present it is in the hands of Greek
traders. As the supply of coin in the Soudan is small, the gum is
used as a kind of currency by the natives, who barter it for other
goods. A small duty is levied by the Government on the quantity
exported, and no one seems appreciably the worse. I present this
detail of information to fiscal controversialists, and make no
demand upon their gratitude in doing so.</p>

<p>The gum-bearing mimosas are, on an average, I should say, about
twenty-five feet high. The boles are straight. Thorns grow thickly
on the branches. The white bark gives a characteristic and almost
haunting feature to the great forest. The gum exudes, chiefly, at
the junction of the branches with the trunk. Its appearance has
been excellently described by Sir Samuel Baker: “At this season the
gum was in perfection, and the finest quality was now before us in
beautiful amber-coloured masses upon the stems and branches,
varying from the size of a nutmeg to that of an orange. . . . This
gum, although as hard as ice on the exterior, was limpid in the
centre, resembling melted amber, and as clear as though refined by
some artificial process. . . . The beautiful balls of frosted
yellow gum recalled the idea of the precious jewels upon the trees
in the garden of the wonderful lamp of the ‘Arabian Nights.’ The
gum was exceedingly sweet and pleasant to the taste.”<a id=
"FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
The trees were in flower when we saw them, and the blossoms scented
the air sweetly.</p>

<p>The present method of collecting gum is primitive and
unsystematic. Natives go a two or three days’ journey from Gedaref
into the forest, when they are pressed by want of a commodity to
sell or exchange,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> and
return with as much as they have gathered at hazard.</p>

</div>

<p>Throughout the day’s march we had seen fires raging in the dried
grass, and we had frequently passed places where the charred
surface showed the effect of the flames. The custom of setting the
undergrowth alight would destroy the mimosa forest, but for the
fact that the fires burn low and travel quickly. The branches of
the trees do not spring from the lower expanse of the boles, and
there is consequently no combustion of the timber, except where a
quantity of old, sapless wood is ignited.</p>

<p>Trouble threatened us at Shisana well. Grain for the donkeys and
boys, that were to accompany us into Abyssinia, had been packed in
sacks at Gedaref. The friction caused by the camels’ movement had
frayed these open, and the grain was lying on the ground when we
arrived. At first we feared that we should be obliged to return to
the town and purchase new sacks; but luckily the camel-men were
bringing with them a stock of capacious and pliable baskets, made
of slit palm-leaves, which they had intended to sell at Gallabat.
These we commandeered, and so extricated ourselves from the
difficulty.</p>

<p>Our journey next day was through entirely similar scenery, over
undulating, rocky ground. We saw some ariel, but again they were
too shy for us. Then we “declined upon” guinea-fowl, and bagged two
after a brisk, exciting run.</p>

<p>The heat was overpowering, and at lunch-time we had no rest.
Bees abound in this region, and get their honey from the flowers of
the mimosa trees. As the land is almost waterless in the dry
season, these insects suffer much from thirst. Even the moisture
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> perspiration
attracts them in their parched state, and, in addition, there was
the smell of water from our drinking-supply. The result was that
they swarmed upon us; in fact, they mobbed us. Every drinking
vessel was crowded with them. Our boys drank from calabashes; when
these were put upon the ground, bees clustered on the edges and
crawled towards the liquor. Impatient successors thronged upon the
first comers and pushed them into the water, so that in a few
minutes the surface was a mass of “struggle-for-lifers.” In spite
of the heat we had to keep moving; for when we settled, so did the
bees—all over us.</p>

<p>That night we pitched our camp in the mimosa forest, six miles
from the village and watering-place called Doka.</p>

<p>Next day—Christmas Eve—we started at seven, carrying our guns,
and had not walked a mile when we disturbed a flock of guinea-fowl.
Away they sped through the tangle of dry grass, and we after them.
We blazed away here and there, but the birds, hit or not, were out
of sight in an instant amidst that cover, and we missed in this way
many that we had not missed in the other. Our bag consisted of
four. When a bird dropped, the Soudanese “gillies,” who were
carrying our rifles in case big game should be seen, pounced upon
it and decapitated it. Otherwise it would not have been clean meat
for a Mohammedan. The land around Doka is hilly, and the ground
rises to a height of which Primrose Hill would be a good example.
We reached the village about nine o’clock.</p>

<p>Here we found, to our surprise, that the camel-men wanted to
water every beast in our convoy. We were but a few miles from
another watering-place, where the business could have been done in
the evening without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
wasting the hours of daylight in which we were able to travel. We
compromised by hurrying up the animals as soon as we had filled our
tanks, and when half a score had drunk, the well ran dry.</p>

<p>We pushed on through the mimosa country. The temperature was
about 102°, and I found the heat extraordinarily oppressive. The
trees around us and overhead—they grow thickly in parts of the
forest—seemed to shut out every movement of air, such as had always
relieved us a little in the open tracts. Our extreme thirst
constantly tempted us. We had made it a rule not to draw upon our
ration of water till eleven in the morning, and abstinence till
then was Spartan discipline. If one began to drink, it was a sheer
impossibility to leave off, and the supply did not hold out. On
calm reflection at a distance, I doubt whether our normal breakfast
of tinned sausages and tea was wisely selected under the
circumstances. But it could be quickly prepared, and we seldom had
time to be leisurely.</p>

<p>While we were traversing the forest, I neither saw nor heard any
bird except the guinea-fowl. The dried grass in which they wander
was the only undergrowth. Usually the place was as still as a tomb.
Of larger animals I saw none but antelopes, and not many of
these.</p>

<p>We halted for lunch in a small ravine, and the bees did not find
us till we had nearly finished the meal. We “smoked” them with
cigarettes, cigars, and a bonfire, to no purpose. Then we shifted
our quarters, but they followed. All of us were stung, and we were
not quit of them till we mounted our camels and outdistanced the
swarms.</p>

<p>We camped for the night among the mimosas<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_34">[34]</span> about seven miles from the watering-place
called Zeraf Zaid. I thought we had been delivered from the plague
of insects, but I deceived myself. Our camp was stormed by hosts of
small creatures—tiny beetles, flying ants, and the like. They
thronged and crawled on one’s candle, one’s book, one’s face, and
one’s hands, and I found it difficult to write my diary. Some of
them—I do not know whether they were prompted by hunger or
malignity—added insult to injury by biting us.</p>

<p>On the morning of Christmas Day we started with our guns in
advance of the convoy and bagged two brace of the usual poultry. I
had not hitherto found the country unhealthy, though the climate
tries one’s condition; but on this occasion I felt “out of sorts,”
and was glad—for a wonder—to mount my camel after the tramp in the
sunshine.</p>

<p>At 9.30 we reached the village of Zeraf Zaid. Here a clean hut
serves as a rest-house. We found the place pleasant and cool.
Within it were trestle-beds, of the kind commonly used in the
Soudan and called “angareebs.” Sir Samuel Baker has given a concise
description of them: “The angareebs, or native bedsteads, are
simple frameworks upon legs, covered with a network of raw hide
worked in a soft state, after which it hardens to the tightness of
a drum when thoroughly dry. No bed is more comfortable for a warm
climate than a native angareeb with a simple mat covering; it is
beautifully elastic, and is always cool, as free ventilation is
permitted from below.”<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> I concur in this
favourable opinion of the native bed, and hope that its value in
cases of sickness or injury that are not serious may be brought to
the notice of the medical<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_35">[35]</span> authorities of the army. It would be easy to
furnish tent-hospitals with this simple appliance in any part of
the Soudan.</p>

<p>We rested in contentment, and then lunched while the camels were
watered. Our convoy started at noon, and we two hours later. We
overtook the baggage at half-past three.</p>

<p>At Zeraf Zaid there is an outpost of “the Arab Battalion,” which
consists of Soudanese natives and Soudanese (<i>i.e.</i>
naturalized) Abyssinians,<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Egyptian non-commissioned
officers, and two Englishmen, first and second in command, with the
rank respectively of colonel and major. The strength is about two
hundred, and the permanent head-quarters are at Kassala. The duty
of the battalion is to protect the frontier and suppress the slave
raids which are frequently attempted by Abyssinian subjects. I
doubt whether the latter part of the supervision duty is quite
successfully performed owing to the smallness of the corps, and it
is well to bear in mind that these raids may upon some occasion
lead to serious political complications affecting the attitude of
the Anglo-Egyptian Government towards the <em>Negus
Negesti</em>.<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class=
"fnanchor">[20]</a> He has but slight control over his more
powerful feudatories near the frontier; moreover, the succession to
the throne will assuredly be disputed upon the death of the present
ruler, and the whole country will then be plunged in misrule and
civil war. It is clear that a very serious state of affairs may at
any time be established in this region. Questions arising from
incursions made into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
territory where the British flag flies from districts where no
effective or responsible government exists may assume the gravest
importance.</p>

<p>The “Arab Battalion” is a sort of legacy to us from our
predecessors, and the men still wear the picturesque uniform chosen
for them in the days of the Italian occupation. It consists of a
white tunic extending to the knees, loose white trousers, sandals
surmounted by white gaiters, a broad green sash round the waist,
and a red tarboush with a green tassel. I cannot offer a valid
opinion upon the sufficiency of this body as a frontier guard in
the event of disturbances over a wide area, and I am not able to
judge what effect the racial sympathy of some members of it with
Abyssinians “over the border” would have in such a case.</p>

<p>Shortly after we had left Zeraf Zaid on the road to Gallabat we
saw a great bustard near at hand. One of my comrades tried to shoot
it for our Christmas dinner, but his luck failed him. However, I
had brought the materials of a plum pudding with me from Cairo, and
hoped that it would be a solace and a pleasant surprise for the
other two members of our mess. The cook obtained some eggs in the
village, and I gave him careful and emphatic directions and swore
him to secrecy. Ours is a phlegmatic race. The cook did his work
creditably, the pudding came to table, and was eaten without
comment. The poultry in these villages is of a stunted size, but
the flesh is tender and makes good eating. Pigeons are to be had in
all the hamlets.</p>

<p>Our camping-ground for the night was a pleasant spot, bare of
grass, and surrounded by high trees. In honour of the day, and in
expectation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
entering Gallabat early on the following afternoon, I discharged a
professional man’s duty towards his toilet, and scraped a week’s
stubble from my face. In the wilderness even a doctor can neglect
appearances.</p>

<p>On Boxing Day we entered rising country with features different
from those seen in the mimosa forest.</p>

<p>The sides of the rocky hills have been seamed with ravines by
the rains. Nearly all the trees are still of the same order, but
certain species have broader leaves, and their appearance resembles
that of the timber found in the temperate zones. However, I saw no
specimen of the varieties common in England. I heard one songbird
in this district, the chaffinch. Water-wagtails abound.</p>

<p>As usual, we made an excursion ahead of the baggage with guns
and rifles. The game birds are sand-grouse and partridges, and we
shot a brace of the latter. Crawley brought down an ariel buck,
which was in good condition. This was our first venison. The shot
caused intense excitement in our convoy, and the guides and boys
all made a rush for the beast to cut its throat before it died of
the bullet wound. It had been hit in the neck.</p>

<p>We rested in a ravine called Otruk—a lovely wooded gorge in
which a small stream was flowing. A little further down the course
the water disappeared in the sand. Here, for the first time, I saw
a troop of baboons. No doubt they inhabit caves and clefts in the
surrounding rocks. Some were fully of human stature. Partridges and
guinea-fowl were numerous here, and beyond question the rivulet in
the khor attracts animals of every kind existing in the district.
It was the first running water we had seen since we left the Blue
Nile.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> We rested until
two o’clock, and then rode on towards Gallabat.</p>

<p>When we were half an hour’s journey distant from the town, we
were met by Mr. Saville, the Inspector, who accompanied us to our
quarters.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span><a id=
"c04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Politically</span>, Gallabat is a
place of much importance, as the principal station on the frontier
between Abyssinia and the Anglo-Egyptian dominions. It is the
terminus of the telegraph line whose course we had followed along a
part of our route, and I shall presently explain why I think it
would be difficult to carry the wire from this point into Menelek’s
country.</p>

<p>The town consists of two main thoroughfares and of the scattered
“tokhuls” which form the villages throughout Abyssinia and the
Eastern Soudan. It contains about eight hundred inhabitants.
Formerly, I have no doubt, there was a larger population, but this
place, like all other trading centres in the land, suffered
severely in the days of the Dervish ascendency. The “shops,” which
abut upon the main roads, are hovels in a row under a heavily
thatched roof, and are separated by rough and ragged partitions of
cane thatch. They are “business premises” only, and the proprietor
and his family dwell elsewhere. A considerable trade is carried on
by Abyssinians who come to Gallabat to sell coffee; sometimes they
have a leopard’s skin or other hunter’s trophy to barter in
addition. They exchange their goods chiefly for cotton, which is
used in the making of <em>shamas</em> and other garments worn in
Abyssinia. Sir S. Baker mentions a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_40">[40]</span> commerce in bees’-wax and hides, but I saw no
evidence of it in Gallabat, and I think it must have declined.</p>

<p>The traffic in coffee proceeds regularly during the dry season,
but ceases, of course, when the rains make the neighbouring
Abyssinian hill-country impassable. A square, in which there are
booths, is set apart for the use of the Abyssinian traders. In the
middle of it are the large scales in which the coffee is weighed,
and I was much interested to learn that not only the amount of the
import duty payable to the Egyptian Customs, but also the sum
charged as export duty by the Abyssinian Government, was here
determined by the weight of the bundles. The latter tax is retained
at the time in the hands of the Anglo-Egyptian officials, and is
afterwards remitted by them to Menelek’s Revenue Department. I need
hardly add that this is a recent arrangement, and it seems to show
that British influence in the Soudan has inspired confidence at
Addis Abiba.</p>

<p>The town of Gallabat is five miles distant from the bed of the
Atbara. It is built on the slope above a small watercourse. This
rivulet and the adjacent supply of drinking water which the
inhabitants use are—in all but details—as they were in Sir Samuel
Baker’s time. He thus described them:—“We were horribly disgusted
at the appearance of the water. A trifling stream of about two
inches in depth trickled over a bed of sand, shaded by a grove of
trees. The putrefying bodies of about half a dozen monkeys, three
or four camels, and the remains of a number of horses, lay in and
about the margin of the water. Nevertheless, the natives had
scraped small holes in the sand as filters, and thus they were
satisfied with this poisonous fluid; in some of these holes the
women were washing their<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_41">[41]</span> filthy clothes.”<a id=
"FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
There are three wells in the town from which good water is
obtained. The soldiers of the garrison use this supply, and it is
available for all who will take the trouble to draw from it. But
generally, the inhabitants, either because they are too indolent to
pull up buckets or from mere adherence to custom, prefer the
“poisonous fluid” procured in the traditional way.</p>

<p>Our quarters were in the dismantled Dervish fort, which lies on
the summit of the hill, above the town. The thick brick wall which
surrounded it is now ruinous. In the enclosure are barracks for a
detachment of the Arab Battalion, a small rest-house, and the
telegraph station.</p>

<p>We set our boys to pitch three tents for us, and before long I
had the indescribable delight of tubbing in my portable rubber
bath.</p>

<p>After this we received, in the rest-house, the interpreter whom
Menelek had sent to await us. His name was Johannes. I learned that
he had been three weeks in Gallabat, so perhaps it had been
expected that we should travel more rapidly than we did. With him
were an assistant, by name Walda Mariam, officially attached to his
“mission,” and a servant.</p>

<p>Johannes was a tall, handsome man, with grizzled hair and beard.
In person he seemed cleanly, but his <em>shama</em>—the toga-like
robe, also known as “quarry,”<a id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_42">[42]</span> which is universally worn by Abyssinians—was
soiled. It is unfashionable, and even a breach of established
custom, for a man to appear in a clean <em>shama</em> except
at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> rare intervals. As
all sorts and conditions of men in the country are infested by
vermin it may be imagined that an Abyssinian’s clothes usually add
nothing to the pleasure of his company.</p>

<p>Our interpreter had spent three years in Marseilles, and we
found that he and his followers conformed to the requirements of
civilization as regards dirt much more closely than the generality
of his countrymen. I do not know whether Parkyns’s description of
the use of butter as pomade still holds good in parts of Abyssinia;
probably not very widely, as Mr. Wylde tells us that “European hats
are getting very common, and are generally of the bowler,
wideawake, or Terai patterns,”<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> but in the western
provinces, where nearly all the people whom we met were peasants,
we saw no sign either of this innovation or that the dairy had been
drawn upon to smarten the <i>coiffure</i>. Nevertheless, greasiness
of person was the rule.</p>

<p>I may mention here that bodily cleanliness is not only unusual
in Abyssinia, but raises a doubt as to the genuineness of a man’s
religious profession. In this respect matters have not changed
since Parkyns’s time. “St. John’s is the only cleanly day in the
calendar; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> in the
evening the whole population, male and female, old and young, go
down to bathe. It is a fact, that, excepting on this occasion,
there are many of the number, who, beyond washing their hands
before and after meals, and their feet after a journey, never
trouble the water from one year’s end to another. My habit of
washing every day in the European fashion gave rise to much scandal
on my first arrival; and it was constantly inquired, ‘Is he a
Mussulman, that he thus washes, and so often?’”<a id=
"FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
The Abyssinians are fond of shaking hands, and it is impossible to
avoid this civility without giving serious offence. Nearly all,
owing to their independence of soap, suffer from a complaint once
associated—wrongly, no doubt—with a highland region nearer home,
and the result was that none of the Europeans of our party escaped
<em>scabies</em>.</p>

<p>Johannes possessed a felt sombrero, which he held in his hand
when we received him in the rest-house. Like most of his
countrymen, he wore a cartridge-belt around his middle. He also
carried a revolver in his belt. His “boy” held his rifle.
Altogether the interpreter was a picturesque but piratical figure,
and it occurred to me that a group of Abyssinian “villains” would
be effective in a melodrama.</p>

<p>The interpreter bowed to the earth each time we addressed him.
He had brought letters for us from Menelek and from Colonel
Harrington, the British Minister at Addis Abiba, which is now the
capital of the country. The king’s letter is a kind of superior
passport, which is generally granted to Europeans who enter his
realm with his consent. It is useful, but is not too obsequiously
respected in all parts of the land.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_45">[45]</span> Johannes had a fair knowledge of French—a
matter of importance to one of his calling, seeing that the
Abyssinians and the French are neighbours, and that an increasing
amount of the commerce and traffic of the country is likely to pass
through Jibuti. A railway has been commenced from that point, and a
concession obtained from Menelek for its extension into his
dominions. Mr. Herbert Vivian has recently pointed out the
important developments which may be brought about by the
construction of the line.<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The Dervish fort at Gallabat is literally a “cockatrice den.” We
speared eight or nine fine specimens upon the walls, using our
knives, and among them was the largest black scorpion I had seen.
The rest-house swarmed with these disquieting arthrogastra, and one
of our servants was stung during the evening. Parkyns remarked
that, though he had several times endured the sting himself without
serious consequences, he had heard of many instances which had
ended fatally.<a id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class=
"fnanchor">[26]</a> Our boy probably had in his mind a similar
dismal record, for he howled till midnight. I had very little
sympathy with him, especially as he prevented me from sleeping. He,
like the other servants, had been provided with boots but persisted
in running about the fort barefoot.</p>

<p>I was delighted by the change of scenery which commenced at
Gallabat after the long tracts of desert and mimosa forest. To the
eastward, the Abyssinian mountains were visible, and there is a
most stirring splendour in the sight of the distant peaks when one
beholds them in the pink, hot glow of sunset.</p>

<p>An escort of ten men had been appointed for us. All<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> these were Abyssinians by race,
but “naturalized” Egyptians, serving in the Arab Battalion, and
they spoke Arabic in addition to their native tongue. There was an
odd significance in the fact that our journey to Lake Tsana
familiarized the inhabitants of the western provinces of Menelek’s
kingdom with an Italian uniform which had become British.</p>

<p>On December 27 we “lazed” and enjoyed our indolence. Our only
activity was to make trial of our patent donkey saddles. We had
seventy of these, and found them anything but serviceable. The
natives fasten the loads on the donkeys by long thongs of hide,
giving about six girths for each animal. Our saddles allowed but
one girth, and, as the consequence, the loads slipped round. On the
28th my companions went to take measurements in the course of the
Atbara. I remained in Gallabat and superintended the conversion of
camel loads into donkey loads. This involved getting the right
weight of flour and corn—fifty pounds—into the sacks. It was
troublesome work done by trying people, and the supervision of it
would have taxed the patience of a saint.</p>

<p>On the 29th we were all busy with the baggage, sorting our
supplies. We took with us sufficient for six weeks. The remainder
was left in the zaptieh,<a id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and we fully expected that
the rats and the white ants would clear it up for us before our
return. Our cook had a touch of malarial fever, and during the day
I gave him thirty grains of phenacetine and nine grains of quinine.
These quantities were effective.</p>

<p>We were to start on the following morning, and sat longer than
usual over dinner, and many yarns were told about Egyptian
officials. One—I hope it is not a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_47">[47]</span> stale story to my readers—ran as follows:—An
Egyptian battalion, under a native officer, had been sent to a
remote district. The commander had orders to telegraph to
head-quarters if anything unusual occurred. He sent off a message
announcing that one of his soldiers had died suddenly, and that he
awaited instructions. The reply was, “Bury the man, but make sure
he is dead first.” The native officer thereupon reported by
telegram, “Have buried soldier, and know he is dead, because I hit
him on the head with a fishplate.” It need hardly be said that the
fishplate was not of the kitchen but the railway kind.</p>

<p>On the following morning, December 30, we had further proof of
the defects of the saddles which had been provided as baggage-gear
for the donkeys. When, after much tedious work, we had balanced the
load on an animal, we started it on the road and turned our
attention to another. Five minutes later, the beast that had been
despatched was brought back with its load under its stomach. My
companions toiled on through the heat of the day; but I fear my
services became rather like those of the fly on the wheel, for the
malarial fever had got hold of me, and the commencement of a bout
with it nearly took me off the list of effectives.</p>

<p>We made a start at last, a little after eleven o’clock, with the
intention of travelling about eight miles, and crossed the stream
below Gallabat by a stony ford, over which water a few inches deep
was running. I was told that this rivulet is never quite dry, and I
observed that in the bed of it were the stagnant pools usually
found in the watercourses of this district. We had seen the last of
the camels at Gallabat, and my companions and I now rode mules.
They are the best mounts in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_48">[48]</span> the rough, steep, and almost trackless region
which forms the western border of Abyssinia. Horses would be
useless here for a journey, either to carry men or for purposes of
haulage; and I doubt if ponies could anywhere be found that would
be more than an encumbrance, at least for long and steady
travelling at a fair pace. I believe that the Abyssinians of the
Highlands use horses in their hunting expeditions and slave-raiding
forays—at all events they do in their campaigns in their own
country—and I have little doubt that the inhabitants of the lofty
hill district adjoining the border tract, who are of mixed race and
bandits by immemorial tradition, use any animals they can lay their
hands on when they, like Roderick Dhu and his men, “with strong
hands redeem their share” from travelling merchants or Soudanese
villagers. But these are “spurts” of work, rapid dashes made by
unencumbered men, not plodding regular marches, and, generally
speaking, those who cannot pass through this country on a mule or
an ass must use their own feet or not go at all.</p>

<p>When my companions and I had advanced about four miles, we
halted for lunch at a pleasant spot beside a brook. After the meal,
some guinea-fowl were seen, and one was bagged. No doubt many more
were hit and lost, as usual, among the high grass. We were in the
saddle again at three o’clock, and reached our camping-ground an
hour and a half later.</p>

<p>The fever had a grip of me by this time, and I rested in bed,
and soon felt the benefit of a dose of quinine. It enabled me to
tackle my dinner, and that is no small boon to a sick
traveller.</p>

<p>Our boys had cut down trees and formed a zareba, within which
the donkeys were penned to prevent them from straying and give them
protection from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
hyenas.<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class=
"fnanchor">[28]</a> I lay idly watching the camp-fires and
listening to the occasional outbreaks of scuffling and braying
among the donkeys, and presently fell asleep till dawn.</p>

<p>The country which we entered on that day is full of rounded
hills. Boulders crop out from the surface of them, and they are
separated by ravines with sandy beds. There is no regularity in the
configuration of these hills, and no uniformity in their size. When
I saw them they were covered either with dried grass or with mimosa
scrub.</p>

<p>The region which we had now reached is, as I have said,
impassable in the wet season, and Abyssinia is then impregnable as
far as its western boundary is concerned. The violence of the
storms and the rush of rain are such that it is doubtful whether
even a line of telegraph posts and wires could be carried through
the district with a likelihood that it would be in working order
for any length of time between May and September.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> The floods would probably be as
prohibitive to an underground system of wires as to one overhead,
and in both cases allowance would have to be made for the extreme
electrical disturbances which often occur at brief intervals during
the rainy season.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the raids that take place from the
Abyssinian side when the country can be traversed, and will only
add here that they are carried out frequently enough to maintain a
supply of slaves for all persons in the country whose prosperity
raises them above the degree of a peasant. For example, when we
reached Gallabat on the return journey we found that eighty-three
Soudanese had been carried off during an incursion which had been
made since we left the place. It is needless to insist on the
difficulties that may arise from raids of this kind undertaken by
people who are, nominally at least, subjects of the Negus.</p>

<p>I can testify that slaves are found everywhere in Western
Abyssinia, but among the female victims I never had the good
fortune to behold one of the class which impressed Sir Samuel Baker
so pleasantly at Gallabat. He wrote, “On my return to camp I
visited the establishments of the various slave merchants; these
were arranged under large tents formed of matting, and contained
many young girls of extreme beauty, ranging from nine to seventeen
years of age. These lovely captives, of a rich brown tint, with
delicately formed features and eyes like those of the gazelle, were
natives of the Galla, on the borders of Abyssinia, from which
country they are brought by the Abyssinian traders to be sold for
the Turkish harems. Although beautiful, these girls are useless for
hard labour; they quickly fade away and die unless kindly treated.
They are the Venuses of that country, and not only are
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> faces and
figures perfection, but they become extremely attached to those who
show them kindness. There is something peculiarly captivating in
the natural grace and softness of these young beauties, whose
hearts quickly respond to those warmer feelings of love that are
seldom known among the sterner and coarser tribes. They are
exceedingly proud and high-spirited, and are remarkably quick at
learning. At Khartoum, several of the Europeans of high standing
have married these charming ladies, who have invariably rewarded
their husbands by great affection and devotion. The price of one of
these beauties of nature at Gallabat was from twenty-five to forty
dollars.”<a id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class=
"fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span><a id=
"c05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">On</span> the morning of December
31, the donkeys were laden and our journey was begun by a quarter
to eight. We were again hindered on the march by the shifting of
the donkeys’ loads.</p>

<p>Our track now lay among craggy mountains, in the rain-scoured
district, where there is no single human habitation. I saw neither
wild beast nor bird, and the country gave a strange impression of
stillness and lifelessness. The flora is quite distinct from that
of the Soudan. The trees are tall and spreading and of many
different species. I recognized the “Matabele apple,” and saw the
hard, uneatable fruit on the branches. The ground in many places
was covered with “bamboo grass,” too high for a mounted man to look
over, and the thick, overtopping growth seemed to shut out the air.
As we advanced during the afternoon we discovered that the grass
had been fired at several spots along our route—I do not know by
whom, or whether it was kindled accidentally or by design. The
flames drove out some partridges, and Dupuis and I thought that we
saw a tasty breakfast for the next morning. But when we moved
forward with our guns the birds, to our amazement, ran back into
the burning cover. The fire died out in the evening, and all was
quiet at night.</p>

<p>There is much stony land in this district. The soil<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> of the fertile tracts is not of
the friable kind which we had so often seen in the Soudan: but
there are many fissures in it, due, no doubt, to alternate
drenching and drying in the rainy season. Our road often lay along
steep and wide gorges, through which an enormous volume of water
descends to the Atbara at the time of the floods. My mule was very
steady on his legs and the motion was easy when he trotted on open
ground. He only showed the waywardness of his kind when I led him.
It was pleasant to think that some sort of understanding existed
between the rider and his mount after one had been accustomed for
weeks to the impassive eye of the camel.</p>

<p>On January 1, a couple of shabby fellows visited our camp in the
morning. We questioned them and found, from the answers which
Johannes translated, that they were the escort sent to accompany
Gwynn and were on the way to join him at Gallabat. He might
consider their company a sign that he was honoured, but scarcely a
sound protection against robbery. We struck our camp after this and
commenced the day’s journey, following the bed of a river. As
usual, there were dry tracts and well filled pools in its course.
Later, we climbed the bank and struck into the country beyond,
continually riding up hill and down dale. Again we saw an abundance
of tall grass and fine timber. The former was dry at this season,
and had been burned in many places. The country here abounds in big
game, but the height and thickness of the grass make it very
difficult to sight animals. We saw a koodoo, three gazelles, traces
of elephants, and spoor of other beasts, but none came within
range.</p>

<p>We had covered fourteen miles by half-past eleven, and then
halted, considering that the donkeys had<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_54">[54]</span> journeyed far enough. Our progress depended
on them, and we were careful not to overwork them. Three were
suffering from girth sores. We pitched our camp in a ravine about a
quarter of a mile distant from the bed of the Gundar Wahar—which is
the river Atbara with an Abyssinian name.</p>

<p>One of our escort was reported ill with fever, and I found that
his temperature was 104 degrees. But quinine had brought about a
decisive improvement by nightfall. I had another patient. My friend
Crawley had chafed his instep, and there was a bad sore on it. I
had recourse to a little doctor’s diplomacy to keep him still, and
put on such a large fomentation that he could not walk. Then Dupuis
and I took our guns and rifles and tramped in the jungle—for the
mass of thick, lofty grass deserved the name. My companion shot a
brace of partridges, and we saw some guinea-fowl, and much spoor of
big game. But nothing more got into our bag, and the excursion was
wearisome and disappointing.</p>

<p>On January 2 our road again lay through hilly, verdurous
country. While the donkeys climbed or descended the steep inclines
their loads slipped as before, and kept all hands busy. The boys
were continually shouting for help, and the burdens were replaced
amid yelling and cursing. These natives never worked without
talking, singing, or swearing, and they were specially fond of
hearing their own oaths. But, I think, very little ill-will went
with the words, and in spite of the endless imprecations uttered
over the donkeys, they treated the animals well.</p>

<p>During the morning I took my rifle, filled my pockets with ball
cartridges, and rode ahead of our party in the hope of trying a
shot at big game. But I found small<span class="pagenum" id=

at intervals along the track throughout a distance of two miles in
front of our convoy. Clearly it would be useless to search for any
large wild beast in the proximity of these groups. I recognized the
men as folk who had attached themselves to our train. They made a
practice of camping where we pitched our tents, and had hitherto
forestalled us in the choice of ground, and settled under the most
suitable trees. They sought protection from the robbers who infest
the district—the most notorious at the time was a Soudanese Arab
called Hakos. I was glad that these wayfarers should enjoy a sense
of security, but resented having sport spoiled. So I addressed a
remonstrance to Johannes, who promised that all camp followers
should keep in the rear in future, and he was as good as his
word.</p>

<p>That afternoon we pitched our tents on the banks of the Gundar
Wahar, which was here a stream trickling from pool to pool. We had
travelled about fourteen miles. My friend Dupuis fitted out his
angling tackle, and tried his fortune in some of the pools, using
an ordinary spoon-bait. He caught three fair-sized fish, belonging
to the perch family. I saw him land the biggest, which weighed six
pounds, and showed fight. It had to be played into<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> the shallows, and was brought
ashore in smart style. Crawley, who was lame, limped to the edge of
the river and cast a line with dough on the hook. He fished
patiently, and his perseverance was rewarded with two little
creatures of the size of sticklebacks.</p>

<p>All the camping-grounds by the waterside in this district are
called <em>warshas</em>, and as there are few distinctive names for
places in the uninhabited tract, we called the spots where we
halted <em>warsha</em> number one, <em>warsha</em> number two, and
so on.</p>

<p>In this region, near the rivers, the white ants are extremely
numerous. They are not seen at a distance from water, and cannot
work without moisture to renew the fluid that exudes between their
mandibles. This enters into the composition of the stiffened earth
of which they build their dwellings. They are voracious and
destructive, and have a propensity for gnawing leather, felt—which
unfortunately they found in the pads of the donkeys’ saddles—and
any textile material. They are most active at night, and, to
preserve our bedding, we had provided ourselves with “Willesden
sheets.” These are made of canvas coated with a preparation of
arsenic, which the white ants avoid. The sheets were always spread
under our beds when we camped, and if anything that was to the
taste of the ants slid beyond the edge in the dark, destruction
awaited it.</p>

<p>I formed the opinion that the white ants have rendered valuable
service to Egypt by amassing the fertile mud which is carried down
to the Nile Delta, and venture to put forward the following
considerations in support of the theory. On entering the Abyssinian
borderland, one cannot help remarking the structure of the ground.
Our track lay generally along watercourses, and the beds of dry
mountain torrents. Here<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_57">[57]</span> the soil was composed of sand, shingle, and
pebbles. On either bank, and for some distance beyond, lay an
expanse of basaltic stone, on which little earth was to be seen.
Grass grew there, but by no means so abundantly as in the plains,
and there were climbing plants, such as convolvulus, and ivy, which
clung to nearly every tree. These creepers made the path extremely
difficult to follow. Further away from the watercourses lesser
vegetation and longer grass appeared. The white ants’ nests, from
nine to twelve feet in height, were found here, usually close to a
soft wooded tree. The roots of it, in most cases, had been attacked
by the insects, and converted into “white ant earth.” The trunk
afterwards undergoes the same process, and by the advent of the
rainy season only the outlying twigs remain intact. A heavy gust of
wind will then overthrow the <i>simulacrum</i> of a tree. The rain
falls in torrents, and the compost which the insects have made of
the timber is broken up and carried by innumerable channels into
the tributaries of the Atbara, and finally reaches the main stream.
It is well known that the Atbara brings down the greatest quantity
of this mud, the Blue Nile carrying less, and the White Nile, the
most sluggish stream of the three, least. The two more rapid rivers
rise in Abyssinia, in regions where the white ant is extremely
destructive to vegetation. Moreover, the innumerable
ant-heaps<a id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class=
"fnanchor">[31]</a> are made entirely of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_58">[58]</span> earth, which crumbles under the rains, and is
swept into the watercourses in the season of floods. And in the dry
months the ants—besides devouring straw and the bark of living
trees<a id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class=
"fnanchor">[32]</a>—eat into every branch and twig that the past
storms have brought to the ground. Carrying earth into their
excavations, they hollow the wood, as in the case of the soft
standing timber which they attack, and leave just the outer
covering intact. I have often stooped to pick up a stick for the
cook’s fire, and found that my fingers broke a thin shell of bark,
and scattered the contents. Another circumstance which seemed
worthy of remark was that we found no deposit of “Nile mud” within
the Abyssinian boundary, nor any earth resembling it; so one may
conclude that, as soon as the Atbara, when in flood, reaches the
level of the Soudan, it spreads a deposit of this fertile soil
beside its banks, though the great mass is carried into the Nile.
According to this view, the fertility of the alluvial districts of
Lower Egypt is in no slight measure due to <i>detritus</i> from
Abyssinia, and the white ants have contributed an important share
to the resources of the Nile valley. Of course, I do not for an
instant contend that all the mud deposited by the river in Egypt
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> supplied by the
white ants, but I believe that the wonderful productive property of
the alluvial deposits is due to the work of these insects in the
western borderland of Abyssinia. Therefore, in my belief, the white
ant has justified its existence, though its room is undeniably
preferable to its company.</p>

<p>On January 3 I saw a buffalo, tried to stalk it, and lost it.
While I was on the way to rejoin our party, a water-buck sprang up
within range—and so startled me, that he got away before I took an
aim.</p>

<p>That day we marched seven hours, and covered twenty miles. Our
camping-place was in the rocky course which a torrent follows in
the rainy season. There were pools in it, and we had an abundance
of clear water.</p>

<p>The aneroid barometer showed that we were now three thousand
feet above the sea, and the air was chill as soon as the sun went
down. It was the first day on which we had reached any considerable
height. At this altitude bamboos form the prominent and
characteristic vegetation.</p>

<p>On January 4 we continued our ascent. The narrow path followed a
zig-zag course up a steep mountain-side. The track was full of
loose stones, and we constantly had to “negotiate” boulders and big
rocks or scramble through cramped passes. In these the larger loads
stuck, and it will be readily inferred that we made slow progress.
I heard of no other practicable route through this region, and
believe that it would be well-nigh impossible to carry heavy
baggage this way.</p>

<p>We reached the summit at last, and saw in front of us, in the
distance, the plateau in which Lake Tsana lies. We were almost on a
level with it. Far away,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_60">[60]</span> many mountains rose in view, clearly
outlined, and showing light and shade in a soft and lovely purplish
blue colour. There was no glacial cap upon these high peaks, though
it is probable that the loftiest points in Abyssinia are within the
line of perpetual snow.<a id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>One of our escort of Habashes from the Arab Battalion pointed
eagerly to the high lands opposite, and said to a Soudanese boy who
was standing near, “Look at my beautiful country!” The soldier’s
manner showed all the zest of a schoolboy returning home for the
holidays. The answer was, “Call this a country! Where are the
people?” Our men from Upper Egypt were puzzled and disdainful. They
had travelled eighty-six miles in Abyssinia and had not seen a
dwelling or a sign of cultivation.</p>

<p>A deep ravine lay below us, and we descended through it and
entered a great gorge which opened out as we advanced. We were on
rocky ground, covered with a layer of earth and loose stones. Our
track wound through dense groves of bamboos, and we had to perform
gymnastics on muleback to avoid a whipping from the canes. In this
uncomfortable covert we passed a party of traders taking coffee to
Gallabat. They had with them about sixty loads.</p>

<p>Presently our convoy, which in extended order covered nearly a
mile and a half, debouched upon the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_61">[61]</span> valley of the river Geerar.<a id=
"FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
The bed, which is of bare rock, was dry when we passed through it.
I saw here many basins neatly excavated in a curious fashion. They
varied in size, but at the bottom of each was a stone. Evidently,
this had first been lodged during the time of flood in some small
hollow in the water-course. There, being constantly driven round by
the eddying water, it had worn a deeper and deeper hole, at the
bottom of which it rested in the dry season. We followed the course
of the river up stream for about five miles.</p>

<p>The valleys on either side are sharply cut ravines in the
mountain-sides. They were covered with grass at that period of the
year.</p>

<p>We lunched in the shade of the river bank, and afterwards
visited some hot springs which were near at hand. The first was a
runnel of clear water guided from its source in the rock to a pool
by a wooden gutter. I put my hand under this, and judged that the
temperature was well over 150° F. At a little distance we found
another spring which, welling from the ground, filled a basin about
forty feet in circumference and one foot deep. Here, too, the
temperature of the water was high, but not so high as to prevent
bathing, and a roof of thatch had been built over the pool. We saw
several Habashes, men, women, and children, who inhabited some
rough, small thatched huts which had been put up close by. Some
were old dwellings, some newly constructed. I could not ascertain
whether these people resorted to the springs for a
“cure”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> or merely
formed a settlement established by keepers in charge of the place.
Apparently all belonged to one family. I visited their
camping-ground, but when I approached the women and children bolted
into one of the huts. Perhaps they had not seen a European before
and did not consider the first example prepossessing; or they may
still have supposed—as most Abyssinians at one time did—that all
persons who came from that continent were Turks. In the latter case
I excuse their timidity. They watched me through the thatched walls
of the hovel just as a rat sometimes watches a suspect from the
entrance of its hole.</p>

<p>The water, as far as I could judge, was pure. It was tasteless,
and very “soft,” as I found by using it in my bath. No steam was
visible at the springs, though before I left them—about four in the
afternoon—the air was becoming cool. Some large trees grew near the
pool, and I saw a big and fine monkey with a shaggy face and a
growth of fluffy white hair on its tail leaping and squatting among
the boughs.</p>

<p>There are many hot springs in Abyssinia, and they are highly
valued by the natives for the medicinal qualities attributed to
them. Probably in some places the virtue of the waters is real, in
others merely reputed.</p>

<p>The most frequented baths are at Wansage on the River Gumara,
which flows into Lake Tsana. Dr. Stecker visited the spot in 1881,
and wrote the following brief account of it,<a id=
"FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
which throws a light on Abyssinian social customs: “The hot spring
issues from the left bank of the river and rises to a height of two
or three metres from the ground. It fills a basin constructed by
King Theodore with water<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_63">[63]</span> of a temperature of 37° C. A hut has been
built over the basin”—as at the spring which I saw—“and the
Abyssinians who are trying the ‘cure’ here sport in the water all
day long. In arrangements these baths resemble Ostend and Trouville
in miniature, seeing that women and men, youths and girls, spend
their time in the bath in lively promiscuity and keep up an
intercourse that is not always decorous. Quarrels often arise among
the ‘cure’ patients, especially when some one has used the baths
longer than is permitted to him. Thus from early till late one
hears the loud tones of the brawlers and the lamentations of women
and children, who often come in for a beating on these
occasions.”</p>

<p>On January 5 our road lay at first beside the River Geerar,
which is the main source of the Rahad. Presently it diverged from
the bank, and the track, which lay over stiff hills, became worse.
At some points the donkeys could not pass, and we had to lift them
bodily, loads and all, over obstructions, or push them past the
rocks between which their loads were jammed. Once the animal that
was carrying Dupuis’ valise and Gladstone bag, half slipped into a
steep ravine with water at the bottom, forty feet below. In another
place I saw an unlucky little beast turn two complete somersaults
while it tried to scramble down a sloping ledge of rock. To my
horror I caught sight of my medical bag on the top of its burden. I
rushed up, and helped to unload the donkey, which seemed none the
worse for the fall, and, to my astonishment and relief, I found all
my doctor’s gear intact. Even the tabloid bottles, with a precious
stock of quinine and phenacetine in them, had escaped by a
miracle.</p>

<p>In crossing and recrossing the river-bed I was able to note the
height to which the floods rise in the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_64">[64]</span> water-courses. I saw that flotsam, such as
wisps of straw and bits of wood, had been lodged in branches and
twigs at least twelve feet above the bed of the stream, and this,
in the upper reaches among the hills, has a width of twenty-five to
thirty feet on an average.</p>

<p>We camped at the foot of the mountain-side which would give us
our final climb to the lake-plateau. Johannes pointed out the route
to me, and I thought that one would have as much chance of shoving
a donkey up the Great Pyramid as up that sheer precipice.</p>

<p>Some Habashes came to us at the camping-ground, bringing a cow,
a chicken and ten eggs. They told us, through Johannes, that the
cow was “a present,” and he said that it was worth ten
dollars.<a id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class=
"fnanchor">[36]</a> We decided to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_65">[65]</span> offer a “present” of fifteen dollars in
return, and counted out the money. To our astonishment, the
Habashes marched the cow off, saying that they would not accept the
gift. We picked up our coins, feeling rather small. But money is “a
good soldier and will on,” as Falstaff had found. In an hour the
animal was brought back, and the “presents” were duly exchanged.
Then there was a wrangle among our Mohammedans as to the ceremonial
proper to be observed in slaying the unlucky cow; for some of the
boys were of one sect, some of another. The question was settled
after much haggling, and they held high festival and ate meat late
into the night. A few choice cuts had been reserved for ourselves,
but the bulk of the carcase was handed over to our followers, and
they left only niggardly fare for the vultures next morning.</p>

<p>A very good impression of the character of the country through
which we had been marching is given by Mr. Dufton’s short
description of it. “The road was very uneven, now ascending a steep
mountain-side, now descending into a deep valley. The country was
magnificent, far surpassing anything I had previously seen. The
high mountains of the Scotch highlands, covered with the fertility
of the Rhineland, would best represent it, but the vegetation was
of a nature quite different from that of the Rhine, characterized
as it was by the luxuriance of the tropics. Once the road skirted
the side of a mountain the summit of which, raised one thousand
feet above our heads, looked down into a deep valley another
thousand feet below our feet. On the opposite side of the valley
the land rose to a similarly steep eminence, which, in one part,
was connected with that on which we stood by a low chain of
undulating ground, so that a pretty little stream at the
bottom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> like a silver
thread in the dark shadow of the mountains, wound about searching
for its channel. Fruitful fields hung over it thick at every curve.
The hills, of secondary formation, were broken here and there into
rocky chasms, through which leaped innumerable falls of water in
their downward course to join the stream; and here I saw for the
first time the beautiful Euphorbia called the Kolquol, whose dark,
candelabra-shaped branches, tipped with bright orange-red flowers,
stood out in deep relief from the lighter ground. Bright flowers of
every variety, most of which were unknown to me, but amongst others
the familiar wild rose, the honeysuckle and the jessamine, lent
their beauty and fragrance to the scene.”<a id=
"FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class=
"fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The knotted sapling which I photographed in the course of this
day’s journey (January 5) has an historical interest which tempts
me to moralize on the variability of human fortunes and the happy
tranquillity of vegetable life. The tree had been growing in this
distorted form since the time of the battle of Gallabat, which was
fought between the Dervishes and the Abyssinians in 1889. I have
alluded elsewhere to the singular vicissitudes of the fight.<a id=
"FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
The Dervishes, in light order, pursued their foes as far as the
lake district, a circumstance which shows that raids are possible
even in this difficult country. The Mahdi’s men, like our own War
Office on a more recent occasion, had extremely little geographical
or topographical information. So the advance party twisted the
saplings to mark the route for those who came after them, and to
guide the force on its return journey to the Soudan. The trees are
the only remaining memorial of the Dervish raid.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>In this region I
saw very few birds. But on the night of the 4th, while I was
getting ready for bed, I heard one whose notes ascended through a
perfect chromatic scale. My friend Dupuis told me that these
songsters are common in India, where they are called “brain-fever
birds.” Whether he spoke as a humourist or a genuine informant, I
cannot say. In the Soudan I had often heard a bird whose notes
reversed the process and <em>descended</em> the chromatic scale
very perfectly. I omitted to suggest to my companion that he should
import some of this species to India and try its performance as a
remedy for brain fever.</p>

<p>On the morning of January 6, we started to climb to the plateau
in which Lake Tsana lies. The ascent commenced immediately. The
narrow track was extremely steep, and, as on the previous day, our
path was full of loose stones and led us over great rocks that crop
out of the mountain-side. The donkeys were constantly slipping and
falling. Some came to a standstill, and refused to budge. We had to
shove the animals by main force over boulders and up slippery
ledges of rock, and at places not a few of them were raised bodily,
loads and all, by means of their tails and forelegs, and lifted
over obstacles. At this rate of ascending we covered two miles in
three hours and a half, and still had a climb of another couple of
miles ahead of us. Then the character of the track changed, and we
travelled round a horseshoe-shaped chasm, following a path four
feet wide, with a sheer precipice four hundred feet deep below us
and another rising to the same height above our heads. It was a
fine sight, and there is a lovely growth of cactus on the mountain
side. Besides, we looked out upon a vast expanse of beautiful
scenery, but I felt uncomfortably like the ungodly of whom the
psalmist said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> that
they were set in slippery places with a great risk of being cast
down and destroyed. “Oh, how suddenly do they consume; perish and
come to a fearful end!”<a id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It was an inopportune
moment to recall the text.</p>

<p>We reached the plateau at last, after another stiff climb upward
from the chasm. I need hardly say that the donkeys were utterly
fagged out. We had left the mimosas and the bamboos below us, and
Dupuis’ aneroid barometer showed that we were some six thousand
feet above sea-level. Here many species of cactus, large and small,
abounded. The soil on the plateau is rich, and the ground was
thickly covered with lush plants in blossom. I noticed, as I
passed, the familiar “red-hot poker,” the wild strawberry, moss of
many hues growing luxuriantly, the maiden-hair fern, and, on the
trunk of a dead tree, the Tonbridge fern. Many springs were
bubbling from the rock, and their courses were marked by the
tenderest and brightest tints of this wild mountain garden. I found
that Dupuis, who had marched at the head of the column, had been
stopped by a couple of soldiers on the edge of the plateau. The
Abyssinian “regular” has no uniform, but wears a dirty shama and
the rest of the national costume, and carries a rifle of an
obsolete French pattern. These men were not acting under Menelek’s
orders but had been sent by the deputy of the chief of the village,
who was himself absent upon a visit to Ras Gouksha, one of the
great feudatories of Western Abyssinia. They said that they had
orders to stop the three Englishmen, and I found that Dupuis had
arranged to lunch at that spot and await developments.</p>

<p>Presently the “Deputy-Governor” arrived. He was barefoot, and
his shama and linen trousers showed that<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_69">[69]</span> he was a sound observer of Abyssinian custom
in respect of cleanliness. He was escorted by some grimy fellows
with forbidding faces who carried guns. The “Deputy” bowed low and
shook hands with the three Europeans. Then Dupuis offered him a
camp-stool for a seat and talked to him, Johannes interpreting.
Menelek’s letter, giving us the right to pass freely through any
part of his realm and calling on his lieges to assist us, was read,
but to our consternation the “Deputy” refused to let us go down to
the lake, which was eight miles distant, until we had received
permission from his Ras.<a id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Three days, he said, would
elapse before this could be obtained. We gave him a drink of green
chartreuse, and then he promised that he would allot a
camping-ground to us about a quarter of a mile from Lake Tsana, but
insisted that we must not pitch our camp on the shore.</p>

<p class="hang1 less">In Abyssinian intercourse the raising of the

</figure>
</div>

<p>After the palaver he remained to watch us. A skin had been
spread for him under a tree a few yards distant from us, and he
lounged on this, staring at us when we were near, and following all
our movements as closely as he could without giving himself
trouble. Long grass grew around our camp, and I noticed some
tamarind trees. We strolled among these surroundings with our guns
and shot a few wild pigeons for dinner. Great numbers of these
birds are seen on the high ground. Then, <em>more anglicano</em>,
we had afternoon tea.</p>

<p>After sunset the air was very keen, and we put on our thickest
clothes. The variation between the heat of the day and the cold at
night is extreme on the plateau, and of course it is sharply felt.
We turned in early and slept in the open. Our guard lay around us;
for we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> were in
strange company. Besides the “Deputy,” who might be calculating
whether it would pay him better to see what present we should offer
and avoid the risk of complications, or to cut our throats as
quietly as possible and loot the camp, we had as near neighbours a
party of Abyssinian traders on their way to Gallabat with coffee.
They had bivouacked under a tree close by. They might or might not
be disposed to share in the pillaging, if any took place. In the
land of the Negus it is well to remember that “no one is expected
to feel ashamed of any crime or vice; and whereas in other
countries men in committing serious crimes are morbidly excited, in
Abyssinia they are perpetrated with indifference, and generally
recounted, sometimes by the individual himself, certainly by
others, with gaiety and laughter. . . . Theft is in many provinces
regarded as an honourable employment; highway robbery is quite
excusable, even if accompanied by homicide.”<a id=
"FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class=
"fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>After all, we slept as peacefully as if we had been in Anerley
or Tooting. On the morning of January 8, we rose when the sun had
warmed the air, and ignored the presence of our dirty warder, who
still kept us under observation. While we were breakfasting I saw a
white umbrella approaching through the long grass, and shortly the
priest of the village hard by came in view. Neither the hamlet nor
its church was visible from our camp. This divine did not wear a
turban, which is the emblem of priestly rank in Abyssinia, but had
on his head the old straw lining of a tarboush. His other visible
garment consisted of a length of yellow and plum-coloured chintz.
He carried a staff surmounted<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_71">[71]</span> by a cross of filigreed iron. One attendant
held over him the white umbrella, which had a blue lining, another
bore before him an open book, on one page of which appeared a
picture—the quaintly stiff and gaudy depiction of saints and sacred
persons which is an unvarying convention of Abyssinian art—and on
the other page I saw manuscript in the Amharic or Geez
character.</p>

<p>The “Deputy” approached the priest, bowed, and kissed the book,
and some of his retainers followed his example. Then Johannes
explained to us that it was customary for travellers to make an
offering to the church of this village, which is on the boundary of
inhabited Abyssinia. Dupuis asked what the usual oblation was, and
the “spiritual pastor” had the effrontery to reply, through
Johannes, that it was ten dollars. Upon this Dupuis remarked that
we had been very badly received and were dissatisfied with our
welcome, that hindrances had been put in our way in spite of the
terms of the king’s letter, and that he should give no alms to any
one.</p>

<p>This declaration disconcerted both the priest and the “Deputy.”
The former departed without further parley. The latter continued to
follow us and spy upon us. Dupuis and Crawley decided to disregard
his prohibition and advance. They moved in front of the column, and
took with them Johannes, his two attendants, and eight soldiers. I
brought up the rear with a couple of mounted men for escort. My
progress was not interrupted, and gradually Lake Tsana came clearly
into view. I found, when I rejoined my companions at the
camping-ground which they had chosen on the shore, that the
“Deputy” had made an attempt to stop them when they were about five
miles from the spot. He had<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_72">[72]</span> given them to understand that they might see
the lake, but must not go down to the water’s edge. Dupuis replied
that he should regard no such order, and marched ahead. Upon this
the “Deputy” shrugged his shoulders, and forthwith took his leave,
saying that he must then return to his house, but that he would
visit us in the evening, and supposed he would find us on the shore
of the lake, as we were resolved to proceed thither. He had an
answer in the affirmative, and departed, to the relief of the whole
party.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span><a id=

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Lake Tsana</span> lay before me as
a vast expanse of blue water stretching to the horizon. The shore
here, near the village of Delgi at the north of the lake,<a id=
"FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
is in places sandy, in others covered with grass. At some points
one can walk to the edge of the clear water, at others the shelving
bank leads, by a scarcely perceptible incline, to stretches of
reed-grown, swampy ground. I saw no water-weed upon the
surface.</p>

<p>The lake lies at an altitude of 1942 metres (6372 feet) above
the sea-level. Its length from the mouth of the Magetsch to the
outlet of the Blue Nile is approximately forty-five miles, and its
breadth on the twelfth parallel of longitude is about thirty-seven
miles. The map published in this volume is mainly reproduced from
that prepared by Dr. Stecker for the African Association of
Germany. How painstaking he was in collecting information may be
inferred from the fact that during his excursions in the native
boats he took three hundred soundings—an example of patient
research which those will best appreciate who have seen a “boat” of
the kind. Dr. Stecker gave the following results of his
survey:—“Lake Tsana covers a superficial area of 2980 square
kilometres. All the islands together possess a superficial area of
about fifty square kilometres, of which forty are included in Dek,
and four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> in Dega. I
found the greatest depth between the island of Dega and Zegi, viz.
seventy-two metres, while the deepest sounding between Korata and
Zegi was sixty-seven metres. Between Dek and Adina the depth ranged
between thirty-two and forty-seven metres. But I am fully convinced
that the deepest places—in my opinion having a much greater depth
than one hundred metres—are to be found north of Dek in the
direction of Dega and Gorgora. One cannot, however, well venture to
make an excursion to those parts in the fragile Abyssinian
craft.”<a id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class=
"fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>This beautiful lake is everywhere girt by mountains, and in some
places they rise directly from its shore. As a consequence it is
exposed to sudden gusts and squalls that sweep down the valleys and
ravines, and these would make navigation risky for small sailing
boats. Hippopotami swarm in the waters. The Abyssinians
hereabouts—Christians and Mussulmans alike—regard their flesh as
unclean; but the hippos do not “lead a very snug life,” as Dr.
Stecker supposed. They are constantly harassed by the natives, who
shoot them for the sake of their hides. From these are made the
whips called <em>coorbatch</em>, which are in general demand and
are much valued. Plowden wrote that “the crocodile, that is found
in most of the large rivers of Abyssinia, does not infest this
lake.”<a id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class=
"fnanchor">[44]</a> So far as my personal observation goes, he was
right. But, knowing the enterprising character of the Blue Nile
crocodile, I should think it wise to verify the statement, while on
the spot, by careful observation.<a id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>I did not hear of
the “Deputy’s” peaceful departure immediately on arriving at the
lakeside, for neither of my comrades was in view. After a few
minutes I saw one strolling towards me carrying a wild goose, which
he had just shot with a rifle, and then the other appeared, coming
from the opposite direction, with a brace of wild duck. It was
clear that the lake country was well stocked, and that the
expedition would fare sumptuously if it were not cut up.</p>

<p>All our tents were pitched by eleven o’clock, and we began to
think of lunch. A man looks forward cheerfully to his meals in the
fine mountain air. But on that morning anxiety about the future
harassed our minds. However, I had no leisure to make forecasts,
for I had to attend to one of our soldiers who had fever, and one
of our boys who had dysentery, and then I found that I was
appointed honorary surgeon to the neighbourhood, and that a patient
was waiting. He was an old man, who had a large abscess in the sole
of his foot, and had endured the affliction for more than a week. I
operated, while his friends looked on. There was no superfluity of
medical stores, and it seemed fair to make “the case” supply his
own bandage. This, when<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_76">[76]</span> produced, proved to be a piece of dirty
shirting. It served, over sublimate wool, and the patient was very
grateful and thanked me profusely.</p>

<p>Parkyns made some striking and interesting observations about
the insensibility to pain displayed by the Abyssinians and the
African races of all kinds.<a id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> He said, “I have never
noticed in Africa any education for the purpose of rendering men
patient under suffering,” and he attributed the power of endurance
to the hardening effect of a rough, primitive life. How far this is
the cause and how far the advantage may be due to a somewhat lower
form of nervous organization than that developed in Europeans I
will not attempt to determine. But surprising as are the facts
related by Parkyns, I do not doubt that he has described them
without exaggeration, and my own experience showed that the
Habashes stood pain well, though I observed no inclination towards
heroism among them.</p>

<p>When I had finished the public demonstration in surgery, I
noticed a small throng of people around Dupuis’s tent. Their faces
displayed their satisfaction, and I joined the group to learn what
had happened. Then I heard that the true representative of Ras
Gouksha had arrived, and that the “Deputy” was a fraud. The envoy
who had now come into our camp had expected us to reach the lake by
another track, and had taken his post to await us. This man greeted
us with a most civil welcome, gave us teff,<a id=
"FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
eggs, milk, fowls—in fact,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_77">[77]</span> all the supplies which we chiefly needed—and
offered to accompany us round the lake and see that we were
everywhere treated with courtesy. He seemed a smart and “likely”
fellow, and any one may imagine our delight in the prompt exposure
of the “Deputy” and the dramatic change for the better in our
situation. We gave our new friend a stiff drink of green
chartreuse, which he swallowed at one gulp. Then he went off to
collect further supplies for us.</p>

<p>A little later the “Deputy” returned to exculpate himself. He
grovelled on the ground, imploring forgiveness. He had brought a
sheep as a peace-offering, and when we had added this to our
belongings, we graciously pardoned him. Upon hearing that he was
absolved from his guilt, he stooped down and kissed a stone close
to Dupuis’s feet.</p>

<p>We had had enough parley for the day, so Dupuis and I started
upon an explorers’ tramp, carrying our guns. We walked about two
miles in a north-westerly direction, and saw innumerable kinds of
water-fowl along the margin of the lake. The birds were scarcely
shy of us at all, and we approached within ten yards of wild geese
before they rose. I noticed among the mass a species of goose like
a big Muscovy duck, with dark green plumage and white feathers in
the wings, plovers of all sorts, herons, pelicans, snake-birds, and
the ibis in numbers. We shot none, for we had meat enough in store,
and it would have been sheer slaughter to do so. I did, indeed, try
my luck with some quail<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_78">[78]</span> that took to the wing, but no harm came to
them, and I was not sorry.</p>

<p>We returned to the village. It was pleasant to see kine again
after the long march through the deserted border-country. They are
here of the long-horned, hump-backed “Zebu” kind common throughout
Africa and the East.<a id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48"
class="fnanchor">[48]</a> My friend Crawley had taken a rod and
line to the edge of the lake. He landed a fish about 2 lb. weight,
of the perch tribe. So we had a very complete <i>menu</i>. The cold
was keen after sundown, but we had a cheery finish to our first day
by the lake, after all. And it would hardly be possible to look
upon a more lovely scene than that which we saw from our camp when
the moon had risen.</p>

<p>We were not astir very early in the morning of January 8, and
dawdled over breakfast until half-past seven; it is almost worth
while to live a strenuous life at times in order to enjoy dawdling
afterwards. Dupuis and Crawley set out with an assortment of gear
to make a survey, and I amused myself with a butterfly-net and a
camera.</p>

<p>Then I inspected my patients. Several came into camp from the
neighbourhood, as I had expected. The old man with the abscess
presented himself, and I found that the injured foot was healing
well. He thanked me again very profusely, and I believe that after
this second visit he departed to the village whence he came with a
good opinion of European surgery. Another Habash found me less
satisfactory as a physician. He had come to ask what medicine he
could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span> take to cure
the headache caused by <em>tedj</em>. Now, <em>tedj</em> is the
beer, or mead, of the country; it is made from fermented barley,
and flavoured with honey diluted in the proportion of one part to
three parts of water. It is a very heady—and, to Europeans, a most
nasty—drink, and the Abyssinians consume enormous quantities of it.
Parkyns was told of a man who was said to have swallowed twenty-six
pints at a sitting, on the occasion of a wedding-feast at which the
English traveller was present. But he regarded this statement as “a
stretcher.”<a id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class=
"fnanchor">[49]</a> I told the inquirer that the one and only
prescription was not to drink <em>tedj</em>, and thereupon the
little audience of his fellow-countrymen enjoyed a laugh at his
expense.<a id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class=

<p>I was glad to see that the servants set to work to wash their
clothes with soap in the lake. The cleansing was needed. Soon the
tents in our camp were draped with garments enough to occupy the
wash-lines of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> whole
suburb. The lake had a pleasant temperature for bathing, and the
men stayed in the water till their clothes were dry.</p>

<p>On this morning we had a visit of ceremony from another priest,
whose umbrella was of many colours. His attendants were a boy
dressed in plum-coloured chintz with a yellow scroll-pattern on it,
another boy, who was naked, and carried a bell which he tinkled
incessantly, and three Abyssinian students. These learn to read and
write the Gheez language, and I think the Bible is the only book
which they study. They are lads from the villages who are
“candidates for orders,” and the theological classes are held in
the church-porches. I secured two satisfactory snap-shots of the
priest. He received an oblation of five dollars with an absolutely
impassive face, and then left us in doubt whether he was secretly
gratified by the amount of the offering or inwardly disgusted by
it.</p>

<p>Dupuis and Crawley resumed their survey work in the afternoon,
and I strolled away from camp with my gun and brought down a lesser
bustard, of the size of a turkey. I also shot a brace of quail, but
lost them in the long grass. Altogether it was a quiet day. The
climate was now very pleasant, neither too hot at noon nor too cold
at night. In the early morning there was a dead calm. After this a
little breeze came down from the north-west, and the wind remained
in that quarter till the afternoon. At four o’clock it shifted
right round to the south-east, and blew pretty stiffly about seven.
We always saw lightning in the evening. It seemed to play over the
lake.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 9th Dupuis and I got our Berthon
collapsible boat ready. This had caused us much trouble on the
upward march, as it is awkwardly shaped<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_81">[81]</span> for donkey-transport. We took our guns and
angling tackle, and paddled about three miles westward. Then we
landed on a sandy beach, left two of our boys in charge of the
boat, and went in search of game, taking one man with us. We had
not walked far when we sighted a covey of guinea-fowl. We got ahead
of them, and were trying to drive them towards the water when about
forty rose in all directions, and we could not reload fast enough.
Several were lost in the thick grass, chiefly owing to the boy’s
stupidity; he could not make up his mind which bird to pounce upon
first. As we were returning to the beach by the way we had come,
Dupuis put up a brace of partridges and shot them. They must have
“sat tight” all through the fusillade, and only rose when my
companion nearly walked them down. We carried about ten head back
to the boat.</p>

<p>When we came to the shore we found our two men in a state of
great excitement. As soon as the guns were fired a hippopotamus
that had been asleep about ten yards from them sprang up, and
rushed into the water, snorting. The beast had nearly frightened
them out of their wits. Looking at the path I had followed after
landing I saw that I must have passed within a yard of the place
where the hippo lay. The men now drew my attention to something in
a tree, but I could not discern at first what they were pointing
out. After peering for three or four minutes I saw a pair of
gleaming eyes above a branch in the deep shade. I fired with number
four shot—the only size I had—at a distance of about ten yards, and
down came a civet cat. It was hit in the head and dead, when I
picked it up.</p>

<p>We tried our luck with the fish while the men paddled us back to
camp, but caught nothing. I set about preserving the skin of the
cat after lunch, rubbed some<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_82">[82]</span> arsenical soap well in, and packed the hide
in an empty cigarette tin. It was brought to England in good
condition. While I was busy in this way, my comrades were taking
soundings of the lake from the boat. Later we went out together
with our guns, and added two bustards, three partridges, and a
quail to the stock in the larder.</p>

<p>During the day, whenever I was in camp, I was importuned by
patients; many had trivial ailments, and others troubles, such as
chronic ophthalmia, which I certainly could not cure during a three
days’ sojourn at Delgi. If they judged that I was not sufficiently
moved by the account which they gave at first of their malady, they
described what they suffered from another, and a fictitious one.
Thus, if I told a man who had chronic ophthalmia that I could not
help him, he would remain to declare that he was consumptive, or
that his feet needed treatment. They became so tiresome at last
that I was thankful for the prospect of resuming the march next
day. It seems to be taken for granted in all countries that a
doctor ought to be more long-suffering than any other person.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 10th I received, by Abyssinian post, a
letter which had been despatched from Port Said on November 25, the
day on which I left Cairo. It reached me by a roundabout road; for
it had been to Wady Halfa, Berber, Kassala, Sennaar, and Gallabat.
I was surprised that it came to hand. The postman was a Soudanese
black, and, when we met him, he was on the return journey to
Gallabat bearing some official communication. These couriers carry
before them—like a wand of office—a long cane, which is split at
the top. The “mail” is inserted in the orifice. The cane is a badge
that is respected, and I was told that the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_83">[83]</span> letter-carriers are never stopped. They amble
along at a steady jog-trot, and cover a great deal of ground in a
day.</p>

<p>We made a short journey of about ten miles to the eastward after
leaving Delgi. Our road kept us some little distance from the
northern shore of the lake, and took us through long jungle grass,
so tall that we could not see over it, and so thick that there was
no possibility of using a gun in it. We camped on a spot where this
grass had been beaten down, and spent the afternoon reading. There
were no mosquitoes, but the flies swarmed into our tents, and we
sympathized with Pharaoh and the Egyptians.</p>

<p>Several of the boys from the Soudanese lowlands had a touch of
fever on this high ground. Three were on my hands that day. Quinine
was a quick and sure remedy for them. I think that they were
affected by the great change of temperature between midday and
nightfall much more than Europeans.</p>

<p>The morning of Sunday, January 11, was very cold, and the
thermometer stood at 31° F. just before sunrise. I noticed that it
always rose to a point above 80° about noon, and these figures will
give an idea of the effect of the variations. The servants were
shivering when they served our breakfast, but at half-past seven we
took off our overcoats, and when we started at a quarter-past eight
the day was warm. Our road lay through tall grass, and took us over
undulating country, and then up a long, gradually rising slope to
Tschenkar, where we arrived at one o’clock. This was by far the
largest village that we had yet seen in Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Tschenkar is four miles distant from the lake. As we travelled
we had skirted the base of the promontory called Gorgora, which lay
on our right hand. This is<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_84">[84]</span> very lofty ground. Stecker ascended to the
highest point of it, the summit of the mountain called Goraf. He
found by barometrical measurement that this was 2134 metres above
the level of the sea, and recorded the following interesting
observations: “This excursion yielded very important results in
relation to the geological formation of the mountain chain. I found
on the high ground extensive remains of a great stream of lava
which I could trace down to Lake Tsana. There were craters half
filled up and very considerable volcanic cumuli. The upper strata
of the mountains consist of crystalline schist, but the lower are
composed of the same sandstone formation in which tertiary coal
deposits were discovered at Tschelga.”<a id=
"FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class=
"fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>In an interview reported in the <em>Egyptian Gazette</em>, Mr.
William MacMillan spoke disparagingly, as it seems to me, of the
resources of the country.<a id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> I dissent completely from
the opinion that Abyssinia has little to offer to commercial
enterprise. Its potential wealth is enormous, and if difficulties
of transit could be overcome—which means, in this connection, if
the Blue Nile could be made navigable—I believe that a vast and
most lucrative development of commerce and industry would follow.
As the question appears to me to be of great importance, and as I
think that Mr. MacMillan’s<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_85">[85]</span> words may spread a quite erroneous
impression, I hope the reader will forgive me for bringing forward
the following evidence.</p>

<p>Consul Plowden reported in his “General Survey of Abyssinia,”
1852-53: “Gold and copper exist, and iron is found in great
abundance; plains of sulphur and various salts, in the province now
occupied by the Taltals, supply all Abyssinia with those
commodities: and other wealth may lie hid in that volcanic tract. A
search for coal would, elsewhere, be probably successful.”<a id=
"FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class=
"fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Dufton visited the district of Tschelga with M. Lejean, the
French Consul, who was then taking gifts from the Emperor Napoleon
III. to King Theodore. M. Lejean found, when he attempted to make
observations in this neighbourhood, that “the ferruginous nature of
the rocks destroyed the determinative power of his delicate
compass, sometimes, when placed on the ground to a matter of 90
degrees. The presence of iron was further evidenced by the slimy
yellow deposits of oxide which some of the mountain rivulets make
in their course. Beds of an inferior coal we also found in the
plain of Tschelga, laid bare by a small stream which had dug for
itself a passage of some forty feet deep. The fact of the presence
of coal, not only here but also in many other parts of Abyssinia,
seems to point to sources of wealth possessed by this country,
which only an enlightened government is required to open
out.”<a id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class=
"fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Vivian considers that the “one insuperable objection” to
industrial enterprise in Abyssinia is “the monstrous craft and
subtlety of the Abyssinian.” He wrote, “You or I might spend
ourselves and our treasures<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_86">[86]</span> in discovering coal, or copper, or iron, or
gold, or emeralds; we might call new industries into being and
establish an era of prosperity; but the Abyssinians would take all
the profit, and we should be left out in the cold.”<a id=
"FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class=
"fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>It seems to me, if one may say so without flippancy, that the
introduction of a few mineowners from the Rand would soon show the
Abyssinian that he is “a child in these matters.” A fertile country
with an enormous range of climate, capable of well-nigh infinite
variety of production, well watered, well wooded, and endowed with
gold, iron, and coal is something more than a small mart for
American shirtings and Russian oil.</p>

<p>To return to Tschenkar. The soil in this region is very rich,
and there is a considerable cultivation of durrha and other grain
and of chillies for cayenne pepper. This is the condiment
universally used in Abyssinia. It is cooked with or added to every
dish, and the natives, including the children, eat it in quantities
which scorch the most hardened European gullet. When it is
remembered that the Habashes usually eat their meat raw, not even
rejecting uncleansed tripe,<a id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and that they are
constantly passing from fasts which they observe with superstitious
rigour<a id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class=
"fnanchor">[57]</a> to an excess of gluttony, that they are immoral
from their early years,<a id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and that drunkenness is an
uncensured habit even among the priests, it is surprising that the
race has retained its vigour. I am, however, bound to say that the
Abyssinian is, normally, hardy and cheery. No doubt the weakly die
in infancy or childhood, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_87">[87]</span> the development of those who survive is
greatly helped by the fine air in the upland country.</p>

<p>I made inquiry of our interpreter Johannes as to the system of
land tenure here, and was interested to learn that the “Lord of the
Manor” leased ground to tenants on the <i>métayage</i> system. He
himself paid tithe in kind to the Ras. I fancy the landowner takes
the lion’s share of the crops; and the peasantry are heavily
mulcted by the priests and scribes. In addition, it is the rule
that all guests of the Ras, when travelling within his fief, must
be supplied with food by every village at which they halt. So the
farmers have to thrive on what is left.</p>

<p>We were, officially, guests of the Ras. In consequence we found
that gifts of <em>teff</em>, and poultry, and eggs were brought in
without stint. All are cheap commodities in Abyssinia. Augustus
Wylde calculated that at Bohoro in the Yejju province, when he was
there, fowls were selling at a rate which would have given eight
hundred and eighty for the pound sterling, and that the same sum
would have purchased eight thousand eight hundred eggs.<a id=
"FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
The eggs presented to us were nearly all bad, a fact which might be
due to a misapprehension about European taste or to a feeling that
waste articles might fairly be got rid of as unrequited tribute.
The fowls made good eating, but they are very small birds. I do not
think the Habashes, at the end of the reckoning, had much reason to
regret our presence.</p>

<p>In the evening we received a visit from the priest, a pleasant,
fine-looking old man. He wore the turban of his class. We promised
to see him at his church early on the following morning and present
an offering.</p>

<p>The dry grass had been fired in places around the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> village, and the flames showed
impressively after nightfall, though their effect was dimmed by the
light of the moon, which was nearly full. We had no reason to fear
being burned out of our camp, for the stalks had been beaten down
all about into a matted mass. But clouds of smoke and showers of
blacks from a conflagration close by would have given us more
discomfort than we bargained for, and we watched the drift of the
fires in the light, varying winds with interest. Luckily, trouble
was not for us that night, and we turned in, with all the
contentment of the well-fed Briton, and slept in peace.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span><a id=
"c07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">On</span> the morning of January
12, we fulfilled our promise to the priest of Tschenkar and went to
see the church. It has the reputation of being an exceptionally
holy place, because the Dervishes made several attempts to burn it
down when they raided the village during their incursion after the
battle of Gallabat, and their endeavour failed. I cannot tell how
the roof fared, for it was made of the ordinary thatch used in
Abyssinia when I saw it and looked very inflammable. But it was
hardly necessary to attribute the preservation of the rest of the
fabric to a miracle. In many cases the entire structure consists of
a timber framework with a covering of thatch, and I never heard
that these buildings possessed the immunity of Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego. But the church at Tschenkar is built in part of hard
baked mud bricks and in part of stone, and the doorways are made of
an extremely tough wood which is found in the country. This had
also furnished the beams within the building. Under these
circumstances the only marvel seems to be that the Dervishes
repeated their attempt to kindle the materials.</p>

<p>The church is round and stands in a circular enclosure,
according to the custom in Abyssinia. The wall of the churchyard is
of stone, and there are four entrances, facing north, south, east,
and west. Cypresses—which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_90">[90]</span> I did not observe in other places—were
growing in the enclosure, which, as usual, is just a small grassy
expanse. No tombstones or other monuments to the dead are seen in
it. The church also has four doors and is divided into two parts.
These do not closely correspond to nave and chancel; for the
<i>sanctum sanctorum</i> of an Abyssinian place of worship is
walled in, and makes a third enclosure. Moreover, it does not
contain an altar but a representation of the Jewish Ark of the
Covenant, which is called a <em>tabot</em>. I shall have occasion
to allude to this custom and its origin in a later chapter.</p>

<p>The priest showed us round the building. The walls are decorated
with the usual extraordinary “sacred subjects,” treated in the
manner which convention strictly prescribes. St. George and the
Dragon and the Virgin Mary are almost invariably depicted, and I
was fortunate enough to obtain some clear photographs in the church
at Korata,<a id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class=
"fnanchor">[60]</a> which exemplify the singular devotional art of
the Habashes. At Tschenkar there were some rude carvings of
cherubim and designs of the Virgin drawn with burnt wood on the
doorways. We were not admitted to the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>.</p>

<p>Outside I obtained a photograph of the theological class, which
was composed of one teacher and four pupils. Their library
consisted of a single book. I could not, of course, decipher the
text, but the volume had the appearance of a very dirty and greasy
manuscript missal. Probably it was a copy of the Scriptures, in the
Gheez language. There was a quaint thatched belfry in a tree, which
looked like a primitive bee-hive or an old bird’s-nest.</p>

<p>We had ordered that the baggage donkeys should be loaded and
take the road while we were at the church.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_91">[91]</span> But we found that confusion always arose if
no European was present at the start, and on this occasion, when we
had spent some forty minutes with the priest, and then made our way
to the track which we were to follow, we beheld no trace of the
expedition. When the train did draw in sight we found that one part
had been separated from the other, and the two divisions were
approaching from opposite sides. It was only a slight
<i>contretemps</i>, but we lost an hour by it on a day when we had
a long march before us. Matters were righted and we moved
ahead.</p>

<p>Dupuis and I were bringing up the rear. At half-past eleven we
found that the whole expedition had halted on the bank of the river
Magetsch, and one of the guides was insisting that we must camp
there. He seemed to have no reason for the choice except that there
was water in the stream and that the place which we purposed to
reach, called Ambo, was, in his opinion, too far off. All the
Habashes were of the same mind as the guide, but we did not take
their view, and set to work to cross the river.</p>

<p>Here—about a mile and a half from the lake—the current was some
twenty feet wide. It was clear and shallow, running over a shingly
bed in a ravine. We forded it without difficulty, and moved on
towards the camping-ground which we had selected. We arrived at the
place shortly after two o’clock.</p>

<p>Our route crossed the two effluents of the lesser Gumara River
not far below Wansage. A concise and interesting account of the
geology and botany of the river-valley at that place has been given
by Dr. Stecker.<a id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61"
class="fnanchor">[61]</a><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_92">[92]</span> This morning while we were on the road we met
the “Sultan of Delgi.” The “Sultan,” notwithstanding his title, is
a subordinate official, the tax-collector of a district. It was
this man whose “Deputy” had met us when we arrived on the plateau
and raised difficulties. We found the “Sultan” a very affable old
man. He shook hands with us, asked if matters went well with the
expedition, and if we were in need of anything. This was the more
satisfactory as he was then returning from a visit to the feudal
lord of the district, Ras Gouksha.</p>

<p>The village of Ambo was destroyed by the Dervishes, and had not
been rebuilt. The site of it is on a beautiful little bay of the
lake, which at one part has a sandy beach that shelves into the
clear water and at another is bordered by a thick fringe of reeds.
Snipe swarm in these. There was no cultivated ground at this
spot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> and no timber
or “scrub.” Tall grass was growing everywhere, and I have no doubt
that the soil is extremely fertile.</p>

<p>The tents were pitched, and after lunch we took out our guns to
replenish the larder. We made a bag of some half-dozen snipe, and
saw an abundance of geese—but they are not very good eating—herons,
and other large and small water-fowl. On the way back to camp we
put up a flock of crown crane and could have brought down some of
them. They are excellent at table; but it seemed a scandal to kill
such fine fellows, and we did not shoot. These are noble-looking
birds.</p>

<p>In the afternoon some natives passed the camp, who had shot a
tree-boa. They were carrying the skin. Without the head, which they
had cut off, the snake measured ten and a half feet. As we had
avoided camping at a village—a course by which we cheated
innumerable vermin—we had no evident claim on any hamlet for free
viands. But I found that a fowl and some eggs had been brought into
camp, and, to do the Habashes justice, I do not think they grudged
the tribute in kind which our presence exacted from them. It is a
custom of the country to offer a gift in order to receive one of
greater value in return, but the rural folk of the lake country had
no such motive—as far as I could see—in furnishing supplies.</p>

<p>We started on the following morning at a quarter to eight. The
temperature was then below the freezing-point, and we felt the cold
keenly. Our road lay, for some distance, through the tall jungle
grass, but when we emerged from it the scenery changed completely.
We entered a broken, mountainous district, where the heights rise
directly from the lake, and the traveller passes from one
surpassingly lovely vista to another.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_94">[94]</span> Many palms grow here, and the banks and dells
are covered with wild flowers—a varied, abundant growth excelling
even that which we had seen on reaching the lake plateau. Great
numbers of butterflies, large and small, familiar and unfamiliar,
some of sober hue, others brightly gorgeous, were flitting among
the blossoms. The giant hemp abounds here, and the stems, some
eighteen feet high, tower above one. At that season the daytime and
the evening were alike cloudless. The whole region is fertile and
charming.<a id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class=
"fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>It is—for that country—thickly populated. There are many
villages, groups of scattered <em>tokhuls</em>, and as we advanced
we found these yet more numerous. They lie, perhaps, four miles
apart on an average. Cattle are seen in all. Very few cases of
serious sickness came to my notice hereabout, and the people
generally seemed healthy, as well as prosperous. I saw no money in
circulation, and all trade appears to be carried on by barter.</p>

<p>As we drew near to our halting-place for the night, those who
were leading our column came upon two <em>tokhuls</em> full of
Habashes. They were about fifteen in number, and, as they carried
rifles of an old French pattern, there is very little doubt that
they were soldiers. I was in the rear, and when I passed them they
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> squatting on the
ground and staring at those who rode by in a manner that was
evidently meant to be grossly insulting. Moreover, they had kindled
the grass on both sides of the track, and we were obliged to trot
ahead in the midst of smoke and flames. Oddly enough, both the
donkeys and mules took the adventure quite quietly, though the fire
was close enough to singe their hair and burn their feet. The
Abyssinian “regulars” are a class apart, and are unpopular; they
are mostly rapacious, hectoring, and ill-conditioned, and are a
bane to all from whom they can levy exactions.</p>

<p>Our camping-ground was close to the village of Tschera, which
stands on an islet near the lake-shore. It is reached by wading
through about fifty yards of water lying over firm sand. Further
out is the pretty island of Mitraha, on which we could see houses
and a church. My companions took out the boat and their guns and
brought back a brace of duck and a green pigeon. Earlier in the day
five guinea-fowl had been added to the larder.</p>

<p>We sent two soldiers to buy meat for the men. They purchased
five sheep, for which they paid four dollars. This works out at a
rate of about one and sixpence per sheep, English money.</p>

<p>We did not intend to resume the march on the following morning,
so none of us rose before half-past six, when “the day was aired” a
little. The lowest reading of the thermometer at night had been
thirty-two degrees. After breakfast, we three Englishmen and
Johannes the interpreter started in the boat to visit Mitraha. It
is a hilly, tree-clad little island with a population consisting of
six families. The people welcomed us on our approach and guided us
through a channel between rocks to a good landing-place. They
seemed pleased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> to
show us over the ground.<a id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> It is a perfectly pretty
islet, with quaint thatched cottages among foliage and a ruinous
old church, and—for historic interest—it contains the tomb of an
ancient king of Abyssinia, John by name. We visited the sepulchre
and saw the open coffin, which was full of an agglomeration of
bones. If they belonged to the dead monarch, he must have been the
boniest man that ever lived, and embarrassed, into the bargain, by
possessing two right arms. However, it was an article of belief
with everybody on the island, including the priest, that nature had
once contrived to stow all that “anatomy” into one human body.</p>

<p>The island is traversed in all directions by narrow tracks
marked by trodden leaves, and there is a thick undergrowth of
weeds, thistles, and thorns. In this tangle I saw numbers of large
spiders’ webs, from three to four feet in circumference. The
spiders are about the size of a shilling, with a speckled abdomen
and legs of enormous length. I saw none of this species on the
mainland.</p>

<p>The islanders had poultry but no cattle. We asked them about
their food. They said, “We eat durrha when we can get it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you eat fish?” we asked. “Surely, there are plenty of
fish in the lake.”</p>

<p>“<em>No</em>,” they answered emphatically. “After King Johannes
was killed by the Dervishes<a id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> all the fish
disappeared.”</p>

<p>It is quite likely that these people are too idle
even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> to cast a
net,<a id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class=
"fnanchor">[65]</a> for it is notorious that fish of many kinds and
of large size abound in Lake Tsana; but, knowing how superstitious
the Habashes are, I would not vouch for it that they did not
sincerely believe what they said. Probably they have little
intercourse with the mainland and invent their own news.</p>

<p>They took a keen interest in our boat, and asked many questions
about it. Their own rafts, called <em>tankoa</em>, consist merely
of a bundle of papyrus reeds strung together with strips of
hippopotamus hide and stiffened by a bamboo in the centre which
serves as a kind of keelson. They do not use a sail, but punt or
paddle with a pole.</p>

<p>When we had finished the tour of the island Dupuis presented
five dollars to the church and community and thereupon received the
ceremonial blessing of the priest.<a id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>We returned to camp. During the afternoon I tried my hand at
butterfly-hunting, fly-fishing in a sluggish stream near by called
the Kumon, and shooting beside the Lake. It was all pleasant enough
sport, but I had poor luck. The butterflies that were worth
catching were always seen when we were in “marching order,” and my
net was packed up. When I cast in the Kumon my tackle mostly got
foul of the reeds and the weeds,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_98">[98]</span> and while tramping along the shore I found
nothing to shoot, unless it were a huge hippo who was basking in
the sun about three hundred yards out. I should have been <i>impar
congressus Achilli</i> if we had tried conclusions, so I did
nothing to provoke enmity.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I was on medical duty for native patients. The
first was a poor little fellow about seven years old, who was
covered from head to foot with craw-craw, a kind of aggravated
<em>scabies</em>. He was brought to me by his father, to whom I
gave half a cake of soap, and bade him take the child to the water
and wash him. I saw that this was properly done, and then treated
the boy’s skin with a weak solution of corrosive sublimate and
afterwards smeared boric ointment over him. The father was set to
wash his son’s shama with the remainder of the soap—an office of
cleanliness which had been neglected at home in accordance with
Ethiopian usage.</p>

<p>My other patient was a man whose upper eyelids were inverted
(entropion), as a result of ophthalmia. This malady is very common
in the country. I removed the eyelashes with a forceps and applied
ointment, but the extent of the injury was already so great that
little good was likely to come from my intervention. The Russians
maintain a Red Cross Mission at Addis Abbiba,<a id=
"FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
which has established a hospital on an adequate scale. Here natives
receive treatment free of charge.<a id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> European medical aid is
sorely needed in the country, and I wish that it might be found
practicable to support a British medical station in Western
Abyssinia. Our popularity and prestige would be increased by this
step. An opportunity would be given for valuable
observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> and
research, and the benefit to the inhabitants would be
incalculable.</p>

<p>Gifts of bread (teff), eggs, and fowls were brought into our
camp in plenty, and some liberal Habash sent us a big jar of honey,
the comb and all packed in together. It was a welcome and useful
present, and served as a luxury in lieu of jam, of which we had a
short supply. The size of the jar—it rather suggested the
lurking-places of the Forty Thieves—embarrassed us, and we did not
wish to carry quantities of honey-comb through Abyssinia. So we
consulted Johannes. He told us to heat the jar until the honey just
boiled, skim off the wax and pour the clear liquor into bottles.
Fortunately we had saved empty bottles, and we filled up all we
had; but half the jar remained after that, and had to be returned
to the giver. All three of us were interested and busy in melting
the honey and straining it through a piece of mosquito curtain, and
were splendidly sticky and messy when we left off.</p>

<p>While we were in the kitchen-quarters, we heard a loud grunting
and snorting about twenty yards away, which made the ground
tremble, and recognized at once that a hippo was in the reeds
there. This badly frightened the cook, who slept in the tent
nearest that spot. We had to assure him solemnly that the hippo
would not carry out a night attack upon him.</p>

<p>We struck our camp next morning (January 15), and marched to the
River Reb. The boat was brought into service in crossing it. At one
part the stream was about four feet six inches deep, and though
this dip in the bed was only a couple of yards wide, it prevented
the baggage animals from walking through. The water was shallow
over the rest of the ford, so that they could keep their feet. All
the mules and donkeys<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_100">[100]</span> were unloaded while we lunched. The boat
was quickly got ready and about half-past two Crawley pulled across
with his first cargo. After he had had about an hour of the work, I
took my turn. Dupuis was superintending the pitching of the tents
and the stowing of the loads on the further side of the river. Then
the fun began with bringing the baggage animals over.</p>

<p>There was no great difficulty with the mules. One gave a lead,
and then the rest swam across, the boys swimming beside them. But
with the donkeys it was a different matter. The men tried coaxing
them, leading them, whacking them. It was all no good. The donkeys
settled into the firm, resolute stubbornness of their kind, which
is invincible, and it seemed as if the expedition would be left in
the condition of a wasp that has been cut through the middle—the
active half in one place and the “portage and storage” half in
another. Sunset began before progress had been made, and the air
was quickly becoming colder. Finally we solved the problem by brute
force. Five fixed nooses were tied in a long rope, and five
donkeys’ heads were put in the nooses. Then we, on the further side
of the stream, hauled on to the rope. It was a “tug of war,” and we
moved the donkeys. Then one of us took the rope back in the boat,
and the next batch came over by “cable ferry.” There was a chance
that the donkeys would struggle and strangle or drown themselves,
but all were pulled across without casualties. The last three made
the journey just after six o’clock. Of course our men had to be in
the water with the beasts to steady them, and keep them in place,
and all worked with a will. Some were in the stream, off and on,
for three or four hours, and the cold was sharp when the sun sank.
Unluckily there was no wood near our<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_101">[101]</span> camping-ground, so they had no fire to
cheer them afterwards, and could not dry their wet clothes. The
Habashes, when they cross a ford of this kind, roll all their
garments into a bundle, which they carry on their heads while they
swim or wade. We were all sorry for the mischance which denied the
boys warmth after a wetting, and we served out a nip of green
chartreuse to those who had been in the water longest.</p>

<p>On the next day, January 16, we had before us the business of
fording the river Gumara, and, to avoid a repetition of the trouble
with the donkeys, we determined to strike away from the lakeside,
so as to reach the stream where we could go over on foot. Dupuis
found that this route would bring him close to the Debra Tabor
road, and at once resolved to set off, on the following morning,
with a light baggage train, to pay a visit of thanks to Ras
Gouksha, who was at that place. Crawley was to accompany him, while
I stayed in charge of the camp.</p>

<p>It was a short march from our halting-place beside the Reb to
the ford by which we were to cross the Gumara, and we did not start
till eleven o’clock. The baggage animals were able to have a feed
of grass, and they and the boys alike were warmed by the sun before
our journey began. All needed a little rest and comfort after the
previous day’s work.</p>

<p>It is a plain country between the Reb and the Gumara, partly
covered at that season by tall, dry grass, and partly by
swamp-grass standing in ooze. In the wet months the whole tract is
a morass.</p>

<p>Many Habashes assembled to see us start. They were tiresome, but
quite friendly. I was much struck by the prevalence of eye disease
among them; <em>trachoma</em> is very common, and most of the cases
which came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> under my
notice were beyond hope of cure. A crowd gathered round me to gaze
at my camera, which was an unknown marvel in this land; for Western
Abyssinia has seldom been visited by Europeans, and I heard of none
who had been in the district since Stecker had passed through it
more than twenty years before. Even cigarettes were a novelty. I
put one between my lips when I had shut up my camera, and offered
another to a young man who was standing close to me. He did not
know what it was, and hesitated about taking it. To gratify my
curiosity, I pressed it on him, and he held it at arm’s length, and
looked at it with wonder and suspicion. But when he saw me light
mine and smoke issuing from my mouth, he dropped his cigarette as
if it were a live shell with a fuse smouldering in it and ran.
Crawley gave a cigarette one day to a Habash, who ate it, paper and
all, and said he liked it.</p>

<p>We reached the Gumara at half-past two, and pitched our camp
beside the ford; it is an unpleasant place, in the line of a
frequented highway. During the afternoon we passed the donkeys in
review, and picked out the best for Dupuis’s expedition to Debra
Tabor. We also made a selection of stores for the journey, which
was expected to last five days in all.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span><a id=
"c08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">On</span> the way between our camp
and the Gumara River we passed many villages. In one I saw a leper
in an advanced stage of the disease. Thereupon I made inquiry, and
was told that leprosy is very prevalent throughout Abyssinia.
Almost all the maladies that work havoc among the people could be
gradually checked by adequate medical control under European
administration.</p>

<p>On Saturday, January 17, I said good-bye to my two companions,
who started for Debra Tabor at nine in the morning. It was the
proper course to see Ras Gouksha, and thank him personally for
allowing us to travel through his territory, and we desired to
obtain from him a letter of introduction and recommendation to
Tecla Haimanot, the King of Godjam, whose dominions lie on the
other side of the lake. This potentate is named after the most
popular, venerated—and apocryphal—saint in the well-filled
Abyssinian calendar. I shall refer to his miraculous exploits and
experiences in another chapter. They are unequalled by anything to
be found in the Golden Legend, and one can only regret that the
late “Thomas Ingoldsby” had never heard of him.</p>

<p>The emperor, when he is powerful enough to do so, exercises a
suzerainty over the King of Godjam,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_104">[104]</span> who served with the Abyssinian forces at
the battle of Adowa. But the difficulties of a suzerainty
unwillingly accepted, are as manifest in Eastern as they were in
Southern Africa, and the country has often been in revolt. For
instance, Consul Plowden wrote that in his day the ruler of
Abyssinia, who was then the Ras of Begemeder, though a titular
emperor was alive,<a id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69"
class="fnanchor">[69]</a> “had been engaged in the siege of a
hill-fort in Godjam now for four years; and another chief in
rebellion, after gaining two battles, had pillaged Gondar, and
rendered all communication with Godjam circuitous or
dangerous.”<a id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class=
"fnanchor">[70]</a> Menelek’s safe-conduct letter is not valid in
Tecla Haimanot’s dominions, and Dr. Stecker, who was provided with
this passport, was refused admission to the country. The German
explorer wished to cross the Blue Nile in the neighbourhood of
Woreb, but was unable to carry out his plan because the escort
officer who had been attached to his party declined to proceed into
Tecla Haimanot’s jurisdiction. The doctor pointed out, with the
logic of his race, that his permit was issued by the Negus Negesti,
and that a mandate from the king of kings was binding on
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> ruler of
Godjam. The escort officer disregarded logic after the manner of
his kind, and Dr. Stecker failed to cross the river. He again tried
to enter this territory from the north at Wendige, and was again
turned back. A third attempt, which promised well, was frustrated
by the double dealing of Litsch-Abai, Governor of Wendige, and
though the traveller finally received a special permit from King
John himself as Tecla Haimanot’s suzerain, he was unable to make
use of it, except for a few hasty excursions by water from Korata,
for he was summoned back to the Abyssinian court before he could
accomplish the journey in Godjam which he had planned.<a id=

</div>

<p>I took a photograph of my two companions while they were
crossing the river Gumara, and then at once returned to the camp
and made arrangements to remove it to a less inconvenient site.</p>

<p>I started on my mule with a native guide and an escort of two
boys, and in an hour and a half reached a perfect camping-ground
about halfway between our last halting-place and Korata. It was a
quiet spot on a little plateau, where a spring rose from the rock
and ran down a clean, hard channel. This was a welcome change from
the muddy water which we had been obliged to use during the last
two days. I returned to camp, and after lunch found—for the first
time in my life—my reputation embarrassing. Patients poured in, and
it occurred to me that if they had had any money and I had wished
to establish myself in practice in Abyssinia, I should have done
very well by the lakeside. The diseases which I had to treat were
leprosy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
ophthalmia, tænia, malarial fever, itch, and certain maladies of
another order.<a id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class=
"fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Among my visitors was the parish priest. I supposed he had come
to ask alms, and sent a message intended to put off the demand,
explaining that I was only the doctor of the party, and that if
there was anything which he required, he must return when “the Bey”
(Dupuis) came back to camp and tell him about it. To my surprise he
sent an answer that he wished to see me and not the Bey, and that
he was not seeking alms. That being so, I was very pleased to
receive him, and found that he wanted treatment for the itch.</p>

<p>When he had gone I took my rod and tried a fly in the muddy
river; but the fish did not rise. So I gave<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_107">[107]</span> up casting, which brought me nothing but
the armache, and went out with my gun. On the swampy ground
bordering the lake I shot three of the big geese that are found
there in great abundance. They were for the camp larder, not for
mine, as I thought the flesh rank and tough. The boys had often
asked me to shoot one and give it to them.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>On Sunday, January 18, I moved to our new camping-ground. It was
a well-wooded spot, grassy and full of wild flowering plants of
many kinds. This pleasant place is called Sara; it is six or seven
miles distant from the lake. Game was plentiful. On the way I shot
a sand-grouse, and, taking my gun in the afternoon, brought down
two plovers of a kind which I had not seen before. One, probably
the male bird, had excrescences of yellow skin on each side of the
beak. There were snipe and quail in abundance, but I did not get
within range of any.</p>

<p>During the day a man came to me who had a splinter of wood about
two inches long buried in his leg near the shin. To remove it I had
to cut down a couple of inches into the flesh. My patient endured
the operation without wincing.</p>

<p>Approaching the camp on the way back, I heard tomtoms, women
warbling after the manner of the country and the ringing of bells.
I supposed for a moment that a stray shot of mine had injured some
one and that the neighbourhood was in an uproar about it, and
expected to find a demonstration in progress. But on making inquiry
I learned that next day the Epiphany was celebrated, when there is
a general feast and holiday throughout Abyssinia. The gathering of
Habashes was in a hut near the river where they had come to be
ready for the opening of the festival. This is the blessing of the
water by the priest, and the people are allowed to<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> bathe in it after the
ceremony. I did not myself see that any availed themselves of the
privilege.</p>

<p>The Habashes, who had assembled near the stream, began their
singular devotions at daybreak. Mansfield Parkyns witnessed the
whole procedure of one of these commemoration feasts, and his
lively account of it is as exact now as when it was written:—</p>

<p>“As we have already stated while speaking of the fasts, the day
before the Epiphany is passed by the priests and other devout men
in abstinence until sunset. During the afternoon the Holy Sacrament
is administered to the priests only, in their churches. After the
conclusion of the ceremony they form in procession, and,
accompanied by the defterers or scribes, and bearing with them all
the church paraphernalia, go down to the neighbouring rivulet.
Tents are pitched near its banks, ready to receive them, and there
is a store of comestibles of every variety, with, of course, the
usual large proportion of beer and honey-mead; the whole of which
good things are from the voluntary contributions of the devout of
the parish.</p>

<p>“When the much-wished-for sunset has arrived the feasting
begins, and it is fearful to behold with what vigour the
half-famished divines set to work. There is abundance for them; for
the food being begged as a supply for the ark, or tabote, the
superstitious people think that they are doing a very godly act in
providing vast quantities, while in reality the only result is that
the priests make beasts of themselves. The whole night is often
passed in alternate prayer, singing, dancing, and drinking. The
songs and dances are both of a religious kind: the latter probably
taken from the religious dancing of the Israelites, frequently
mentioned in the Bible, is merely a peculiar sort of shrugging
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span> the body and
stamping with the feet. The end of these devotional orgies is the
administration of the Sacrament before sunrise; but it not
unfrequently happens that long before that time many of the priests
are not in a very fit state to partake of it, disgraceful scenes of
drunkenness often disturbing these religious festivals. During the
evening of timkat, or the Epiphany, that I passed at Adoua, several
of the holy priests were found to have tumbled into the
neighbouring brook, Assam, overcome, as charitably disposed persons
may have said, by their religious fervour; though some sinful
scoffers—myself included, I fear—suggested that liquor might have
been the cause of their overthrow.</p>

<p>“After the Sacrament has been distributed among the priests, the
chief priest, raising his hands over the stream, blesses it, and
then the people bathe in it. Great men, however, and priests, are
sprinkled, to obviate the necessity of their mixing, even in such a
ceremony, with the vulgar herd. After this the women dance and
sing, and the men engage in various sports.”<a id=
"FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class=
"fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The “dancing” of the women seemed to me not unlike that which is
customary in Egypt and the Soudan. The chief feature of it was the
protruding of the chest and chin alternately. The more forcibly
this was done the more excellent was the style of the dancer.
During the performance they gasp like whirling dervishes.</p>

<p>The Abyssinian women are not kept in seclusion. Indeed, the
liberty which they have would be considered license from a European
point of view. But perhaps they had been shy of appearing before a
band of strangers. Anyhow, I had had no opportunity of forming an
opinion about the girls of Ethiopia while we travelled among the
villages. They came in numbers<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_110">[110]</span> to the combined church-service and dance
which was in progress by the river, and I then found that some were
very decidedly good-looking. I took a couple of snap-shots of one
leading beauty, and the reader can determine for himself—or
herself—if she is fascinating. Tastes differ in these matters; but
it is fair to her to say that the charm of an animated, varying
expression and of lithe, graceful movements is poorly represented
in a photograph.</p>

<p>I took my place among the crowd, not by preference—for the
Habash resembles Gargonius more than Rufillus<a id=
"FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class=
"fnanchor">[74]</a>—but that I might use my camera effectively.
Some of the young girls had one-half of the head shaved, and this,
I learned, was a sign that they had not yet “come out.” It
corresponded to short frocks and hair down the back among us.
Marriageable maidens had a tonsure—an odd contrast to our
employment of the same sign, more especially as it further denotes
that the damsel wishes to be mated. As far as I could discern the
dances are arranged by the older women with the object of letting
the girls be seen to advantage, and I noticed that the tonsures had
all been neatly renewed for the occasion. The hair grows naturally
in stiff ringlets, and these, springing up vigorously around the
shaven circle, make it a very striking feature. The married women
wear their hair plaited in rolls, which are saturated with
grease.<a id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class=
"fnanchor">[75]</a> The gathering broke up about eleven o’clock in
the morning and the “congregation” left the bank of the stream. The
“recessional” was the tinkling of a bell carried by a
miserable-looking little boy, who was dressed in a red gown. He
headed the party; then came the priest,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_111">[111]</span> bearing a cross, and behind him the laity.
It was a quaint and interesting sight.</p>

<p>When the camp was quiet again I turned my attention to
entomology and went out with a butterfly-net and a tin box to hold
captures. Behind me was a boy carrying my gun—a sort of Friday to
my Robinson Crusoe. We walked down the stream, and I saw many green
swallow-tail butterflies, but they were much too quick to be caught
by my pursuit. Presently I noticed that they were attracted by a
certain red mossy growth in the water, so I waited near a patch of
this. A butterfly hovered over it, and I made a dash for the
specimen, and got it, but damaged it in the process. Then I laid
it, in as life-like an attitude as I could give it, on the moss,
and by this means secured four fine specimens which came to see
what my decoy had found.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I wandered up stream and saw one snipe, which I
shot as part of the menu for dinner. Then I left the course of the
river, and walked towards some trees which seemed to form a
detached clump. But as I drew nearer and fresh ground became
visible, I found that they were part of a fine wood. When I was
close to the edge of it, four quail rose at my feet. I tried to hit
one, but was not sharp enough. At the noise of the discharge a
large bush-buck sprang up in alarm and scampered off among the
shrubs. The trees were chiefly of the cypress family, and,
following a footpath, I discovered the explanation of this; for I
came to an old ruinous church, and the whole grove had spread
gradually from its enclosure. Beyond the church there was open
ground, and a village lay at a little distance. The scene was
sunny, pleasant, and almost idyllic. I retraced my steps and
completed my bill of fare by adding a pigeon to the snipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>The next day
(January 20) I was medical officer to the country-side again until
half-past ten. One man had a half-inch splinter of wood buried in
his leg. He, like my former patient in a similar plight, was very
plucky and let me cut down on it and take it out. When I had
dressed the wound, he showed the zeal of his gratitude by throwing
himself upon the ground and trying to kiss my boots. Several of my
“cases” sent me offerings of eggs. About two dozen came in
altogether, a couple from one, three from another, and so on. I was
gratified, because these voluntary gifts, though they were small,
were tokens of good-will. Ordinarily the escort-officer<a id=
"FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
whom Ras Gouksha, according to the custom of the country, had told
off to attend us, and whom we called “the tout,” extorted
provisions for us from the villagers—bread, milk, eggs, honey,
grain, and the like, we being entitled to levy this tribute as the
official guests of the Ras. The “tout” had gone with my companions
to Debra Tabor, and it was pleasant to find that, in his absence, I
received “benevolences” of another kind. This man professed to be
our guide for the journey round the lake, but we found that he knew
nothing at all about the roads and tracks. I may add that the eggs
spontaneously given were all new-laid, while those exacted most
emphatically were not.</p>

<p>After lunch I went out with my gun, and shot, besides a brace of
pigeons, a pair of fly-catchers of a very pretty kind. Their
plumage seemed to be worth preserving and I skinned them in the
afternoon. Later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> I
had a complimentary visit from the priest. We exchanged our
respects in silence, by pantomime. He bowed and displayed his
deference ceremoniously in dumb-show, and I bowed in return, and
then the formalities ended. After this I talked to him by the aid
of Johannes. This priest was a leper suffering from the form of the
malady called “nerve leprosy.” He, poor fellow, had not known the
fact until I told him. I almost regretted that I had unwittingly
ended his ignorance. He showed the greatest astonishment and
interest while he listened to an account of the methods employed in
the treatment of the disease in Europe.</p>

<p>I was up early on the morning of January 21, and set to work to
put a coat of paint on the boat, but patients soon found me out and
changed my occupation. One case interested me much. It was that of
an old lady, a <em>dear</em> old lady, who told me that she was a
hundred years old! Why she reversed feminine tradition by saying
that, I cannot tell; upon closer observation I judged her age to be
about fifty-five, allowing for the earlier senescence of Oriental
people. She had heard of me in Tigre, eighty-five miles distant,
and had come all the way to Sara that I might examine her broken
wrist. The fracture was a fortnight old, and I found that the bone
had been set very sensibly, and bound up with a ligature made of
strips of cane strung together upon a piece of leather. This made
an excellent splint. The injury was in a favourable position, and
the <i>soi-disant</i> centenarian had full use of her fingers. I
set up the fracture just as it had been bound before, only with
cotton-wool, a couple of bits of cardboard and a neat new bandage.
I thought that, as the patient had made such a journey to consult
me, she deserved that much treatment, and she would have been
sorely disappointed if she<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_114">[114]</span> had returned to Tigre with no outward and
visible sign of the European doctor’s attention to show to her
friends. As it was, she was pleased and grateful, and took the
homeward road forthwith in all contentment.</p>

<p>About four o’clock in the afternoon my companions returned from
Debra Tabor. They had been received three times “in audience” by
the Ras, but I did not gather that any very deep impression had
been made upon them. They were, in fact, relieved to think that no
more visits of ceremony were in prospect. To the grief of all, one
of our soldiers had died on the journey. He was seized with fever
the day after he started, rapidly became worse, had to be left in a
hut some six miles out of Debra Tabor, and succumbed during the
evening of the second day of his illness. From a description of the
symptoms, I judged that his death was caused by severe intestinal
irritation, probably due to ptomaine poisoning. This, in all
probability, resulted from eating putrescent meat, a practice which
we could not suppress among our men, though it was particularly
likely to be fatal in such a climate as that of Abyssinia.</p>

<p>My companions brought with them some guinea-fowl and a sheep,
and we bought an ox in camp, which was to be killed the next day at
Korata. The cost of it was seven dollars, or about twelve shillings
and six pence, the vendor reserving the hide for his own purposes
as a condition of the bargain. That night a hyena was prowling
round my tent. I was not sure what manner of beast it was until
Crawley enlightened me next day. It certainly would not be safe for
a traveller to sleep in the open in places haunted by these
creatures.</p>

<p>On the morning of January 22, after some delay in starting, we
made a steady jog-trot journey, through dried grass in a
well-timbered country, down the gentle<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_115">[115]</span> slope that trends away from the plateau.
The track which we followed was rocky for the most part, and lay in
cultivable land. We saw enclosed fields here and there and numerous
villages—one in every four miles or so. There was no mishap, except
when the donkeys stuck in the mud at the bottom of the
watercourses, or lay down in it. And then it was dirty work to get
them on, or up. Just before one o’clock we arrived in Korata Bay
and pitched our camp there.</p>

<p>After lunch my companions started on muleback with their guns.
They were to be guided by a native boy about eighteen years old,
whom our interpreter Johannes had engaged in the town, and who said
that he knew where game was to be found. Crawley took the young
fellow’s staff in one hand, and in the other held out a
Maria-Theresa dollar, and made him understand by signs that if the
sport was good he would get the money, but if no game was seen he
would have a cudgelling. The humour of this tickled his fancy very
much, and he was convulsed with laughter over it. It was the first
time I had seen an Abyssinian enjoy a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>Korata stands upon a promontory. When I had held a “doctor’s
parade,” I took my gun and walked round the point of this little
headland. There appeared to be no birds to shoot, and I had made up
my mind to turn back empty-handed, when I saw a couple of fat
little ducks on a rock in the lake. I shot them when they rose,
and, knowing they were dead, sat down to wait till the waves
brought them within reach. The noise of the firing roused the
curiosity of two Abyssinians, who came up to me and bowed. Then one
very obligingly walked into the water and fetched out the birds.
After this both accompanied me, the first carrying the ducks, the
other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> bearing my
gun. I understood that they meant to show me the way over the brow
of the hill and through Korata to our camp.</p>

<p>We left the sandy beach, and walked up a rocky track full of
loose stones into the town. It is merely a collection of tokhuls
scattered in groups of six or seven among untended coffee
plantations. These are not separated by hedges or fences, and
perhaps I might best convey an idea of their appearance to an
English reader by comparing them to a series of neglected orchards
without traceable boundaries. Indeed, I should have supposed that
the coffee bushes, which attain a most remarkable size, grew wild
here, if it were not for a statement in Consul Plowden’s report. He
wrote: “The more temperate provinces would probably be favourable
to the growth of pepper, spices, and coffee, which last has already
been planted at Korata.”<a id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Evidently the soil is
admirably suited for the raising of this produce to advantage; the
coffee is of an excellent quality, and though the natives bestow no
trouble and spend no money on the industry, there is even now a
steady export trade in the berries from this district. The
principal market for it is in the Soudan, where the demand is
likely to be larger as the development of Upper Egypt proceeds.</p>

<p>We traversed the main thoroughfare on the way back to camp. It
is so narrow that two persons cannot pass abreast. On either side
is a bank overgrown with nettles and other weeds. I saw very few
people; the life of the place seemed to be stagnant, and here, as
elsewhere in Abyssinia, there was very little money in circulation.
Judging roughly, I should estimate that Korata contains a
population of some two thousand, and that three-quarters of these
are Soudanese slaves. It is<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_117">[117]</span> the custom among the Habashes that each man
has a boy-slave, and each married woman a girl-slave. The attitude
of mind of the Christian Abyssinians towards these wretched people
is well shown by the following slight incident—as I was walking
through Korata with the two Habashes who had volunteered to guide
me, we passed a couple of slave-boys. I said, “Soudanis,” and
immediately my companions spat upon the ground to signify their
contempt.</p>

<p>When we reached camp I gave my new acquaintances a drink of
chartreuse in token of my gratitude, and then they squatted in
front of my tent, and seemed greatly interested in watching me
while I dressed a wound on the leg of one of the donkey-boys. They
were doing no harm, but “the tout” bustled up in his most
consequential mood to hurry them off, and I think he hit one of
them. Anyhow, there was some disturbance, and the other Habashes
made common cause. The corporal came to report to me that the
escort officer was drunk, and had struck a man. Thereupon I
summoned “the tout” and rated him, and ordered him to go and
apologize to those visitors of mine, who had done me a service.
Matters straightened themselves out, for the two men came to me
half an hour later to say good-bye, and they appeared to be
perfectly happy and contented. They “bowed and scraped” in the
usual Abyssinian manner before they took their departure. “The
tout” made some representation to Dupuis when he returned to camp;
so I explained that the fellow was tipsy and troublesome, and he
was sent about his business. I gathered that he asked leave to go,
and hoped that he meant to quit us altogether, but found afterwards
that he had only sought permission to spend the night in the
town—over more tedj, of course. Dupuis paid no heed<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> to what he was saying, so off
he went, but came back in an unruffled mood, and full of
complacency, on the following morning. I think Johannes gave us the
explanation of his conduct—that he had orders from the Ras to make
sure that we three Europeans should have as little intercourse as
possible with the Habashes.</p>

<p>That night the noise in our camp disturbed a hippo, whose
resting-place in the reeds was close by. I heard him snorting
loudly and angrily. He had a prescriptive right to quiet sleep in
that place, and I felt that we were intruders upon the ancient
order. The old-world life seemed to have a <i>raison d’être</i>
superior to that of a modern expedition, and though the hippo kept
me awake, I sympathized with his indignation.</p>

<p>He and his kind were prominent figures in the scene next morning
(January 23). We counted five that were in sight together, and four
were less than two hundred yards from the shore.</p>

<p>After breakfast we visited the celebrated church of Korata. I am
not sure that it is the only one in the place, but its reputation
makes it <em>the</em> church of Korata. We were told that a certain
Frenchman had travelled from France expressly to see it; if he did,
it will be owned that he was an exceptional Gaul, for the length
and discomfort of his journey were out of all proportion to the
satisfaction to be obtained at the end of it. The building—as my
photograph of the exterior shows—is circular, with thatched walls,
and in point of structure differs only in size from the village
churches. It stands in a compound, surrounded by a rough stone
wall. The entrances are two lich-gates, surmounted by thatched
porticoes.</p>

<p>The church owes its especial sanctity to the patronage of a
female saint. Her chief exploit has been described<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam, and as
the passage in which he recounts it is full of the “atmosphere” of
the country, I quote it in full:—“In accordance with orders from
the King (Theodore) the two principal merchants of the place
(Korata) Aito Kasa and Aito Wandé—the latter, as mentioned above,
the person on whom Theodore had bestowed Lij Tasamma’s sister, one
of his favourite concubines—came out in a wherry to meet us about a
mile from the shore, clad in gorgeous habiliments. After an
interchange of civilities, we followed them to a small plateau
which rises above the lake about two miles to the south of the
town, where upwards of a hundred ecclesiastics from the
neighbourhood were assembled to welcome us, his Majesty having
directed the clergy to receive me with royal honours, and to take
care that their persons and garments were scrupulously clean. They
were in full canonicals, and greeted us with prayers and psalmody,
conducting us with the same accompaniments to a tent which had been
erected for the occasion, a few yards from our landing-place. The
glitter of the pageant was heightened by a grand display of
crosses, croziers, mitres, church umbrellas, David’s harps and
censers, which were born aloft in the procession. After spending a
short time witnessing their religious dances and listening to their
discordant chants, the benediction was pronounced, and the Lord’s
Prayer wound up the service, when we accompanied the merchants to
their dwellings on mules provided for our use. Korata rejoices in a
patron saint of great celebrity—a native Joan of Arc, in
fact—called Waldt-Maryam. She was a resident nun when a formidable
Galla Chief, who had overrun a great part of the country, appeared
before Korata. She encouraged the townsmen to defend the place, and
their valour combined with her powerful intercessions
availed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> to
withstand the repeated assaults of the infidel hosts, who were
eventually obliged to retreat with great loss. Since that time the
town has been placed under her special patronage, and to show their
veneration for the locality Abyssinians generally dismount on
approaching it, and walk on foot through the streets.”<a id=

<p>It is curious to reflect that the name of this remote little
township in Western Abyssinia was once very familiar to British
ears, and it would scarcely be straining an accepted phrase to say
that the eyes of the nation were turned towards this place; for
while the British mission was here and King Theodore was encamped
on the peninsula of Zegi, on the opposite shore of the lake, the
negotiations about “the captives” reached and passed the crucial
stage in the early months of 1866. The end of the story, as the
whole world knows, was the suicide of the King at Magdala. It is
difficult even now, in spite of all that has been written on the
subject, to judge how far he was mad and how far sane, how far a
capricious, clever, cruel savage, and how far a man of good parts
and fine character marred by circumstances.</p>

<p>In the church of Korata we first saw Abyssinian frescoes. It
struck me that they had an unmistakable resemblance to the Persian
style, and, in some instances, in spite of their crudity, the
depiction of the faces is good. The “exposure” photographs which I
obtained show the types of the subjects represented. Saint George,
who is the patron of Abyssinia as he is of England, is always a
prominent figure. The holy people who, by established usage, are
admitted to the “goodly fellowship” on the walls include certain
worthies of the Apocrypha. The picture which struck<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> me most showed the Virgin and
Child crossing the Red Sea—probably during the flight to Egypt—in
an Abyssinian rush-boat and feeding hippopotami with bread as they
went. They are seated in the stern and are rowed by a Habash.</p>

</div>

<p>The church of Korata has a large staff of priests and
<em>defterers</em> or scribes.<a id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> To benefit fully by the
sanctity of the place, they sleep in the porches, on the beds which
are called <em>angareebs</em> in the Soudan. A theological school
is attached to the holy building, and we saw five or six of the
students. One of them was suffering from the disease which Stecker
found to be so distressingly prevalent in Abyssinia. The Chief
Priest received us very graciously. He was much interested when we
named the saints depicted in the frescoes, and appeared suddenly to
realize that we were Christians. He seemed to have the impression
that an English official’s training comprised instruction in all
handicrafts; for he put into my friend Dupuis’s hands the separate
parts, including the mainspring and all the wheels, of an old
silver timepiece, and signified through the interpreter to my
astonished companion that he was desired to put them together again
and return the watch in working order. Dupuis explained that he was
not a “practical jeweller and repairer.” The agreeable old
dignitary, whose name was John, received an offering of ten dollars
with great gratitude.</p>

<p>Later in the day he sent me as a patient one of his students,
who was suffering from ophthalmia. This man brought a citron for
each of us three Europeans; why, I cannot guess, for this pulpy
kind of lemon is not a useful gift, nor a delight for a
<i>gourmet</i>. The fruit may have had some symbolical meaning,
but, if so, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
remained in ignorance of it. I saw many other patients. Nearly all
suffered from trivial ailments. A woman and her husband, who both
appeared to be in sound health, kept trying to tell me some long
tale or other, hovered about near me, and drew my attention at
every turn. Finally they induced a soldier to interpret for them,
and besought me to attend to the woman’s case. When I examined her,
I found that she had come to consult me about the traces of the
scar of an abscess which had healed, as far as I could judge, some
twenty years before! This blemish on her “beauty” was about the
size of a shilling.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went shooting. The boy—Zody by name—who had
been so tickled by my friend’s dumb-show on the previous day, and
had earned his dollar by taking my comrades where guinea-fowl were
plentiful, again attached himself to our party. He guided us well,
and we made a good bag of quail, guinea-fowl, and partridges.</p>

<p>When we returned we found that we had received a present from
the lady of the Ras in whose dominions we were. It consisted of
loaves of “teff” bread, ten fowls, sixty eggs and a jar of honey.
All this we distributed among the men. The Ras’s wife was owner of
the soil hereabouts; it had been given to her as dowry, and in such
a case a woman has practically absolute proprietorship, and the
taxes are collected for her benefit. But her authority does not
extend to the selection of officials; that power remains in the
hands of the Ras. As the Mussulmans had killed during the day the
ox which we had bought for twelve shillings and sixpence, the men
had plenty of good fare before them, and our own larder was not
badly stocked. Vultures of enormous size gathered round the spot
where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> animal
was slaughtered, and fought over the offal that was left on the
ground. Numbers of carrion crows had flocked to the feast, and had
to be spectators for the most part. But they slipped in among the
big combatants now and then, and filched away a morsel
adroitly.</p>

<p>I have given rather fully my impressions of Korata, which is a
typical township of Western Abyssinia. It may interest the reader
if I supplement it by the brief note written by Stecker, who
sojourned in the place more than a fortnight. He wrote—</p>

<p>“On April 1” (1881) “we reached Korata, the most important, most
charmingly situated and largest town on Lake Tsana. Korata has
often been visited by Europeans before, most recently by Piaggia,
who stayed here about a year and a half and occupied himself with
ornithology. Korata is famous for the first-rate excellence of its
coffee, which, as I was able to satisfy myself, flourishes here
exceptionally. The place is almost the most important market on the
Tsana, but at the moment does not contain more than eight hundred
to one thousand inhabitants against three thousand in Theodore’s
time, as very many have either migrated from the town or died of
fever. At an earlier time the Mohammedans were numerous here, but
most of them emigrated to Gallabat after the order issued to them
by King John that they should one and all embrace Christianity.
Only a few families abandoned Islamism and adopted the Coptic
faith. There are also three Jewish families living here. Korata is
divided into ten districts whose names are Dengelteffa, Tukuwodeb,
Margeza, Kulomalfia, Siet biet Negus, Guaguata, Guwi, Adisamba, Vof
tschogevia, Gusudur, and Slam biet (or Slam modeb), which last is
at present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> entirely
deserted. Korata is the abode of an exceptionally numerous
priesthood.” Dr. Stecker formed friendships among the laity in the
place, but “by no means lived in the best harmony with the
pretentious clergy.”<a id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80"

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">We</span> remained two days at
Korata in order to replenish our stock of grain and other
provisions. During this time I watched the birds of prey as closely
as I could. They are of the same species as those found in the
Soudan, and my rough and brief observations, so far as they went,
altogether confirmed the interesting remarks of Sir S. Baker on the
subject. The passage illustrates so well the brilliant combination
in that explorer of keen sportsmanship, and rare ability in the
study of natural history that I need offer no apology for quoting
it:—</p>

<p>“A question has been frequently discussed whether the vulture is
directed to his prey by the sense of smell, or by keenness of
vision; I have paid much attention to their habits, and, although
there can be no question that their power of scent is great, I feel
convinced that all birds of prey are attracted to their food
principally by their acuteness of sight. If a vulture were blind it
would starve; but were the nostrils plugged up with some foreign
substance to destroy its power of smell, it would not materially
interfere with its usual mode of hunting. Scent is always stronger
near the surface of the ground: thus hyenas, lions, and other
beasts of prey will scent a carcase from a great distance, provided
they are to leeward; but the same animals would<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> be unaware of the presence of
the body if they were but a short distance to windward.</p>

<p>“If birds of prey trusted to their nostrils, they would keep as
near the ground as possible, like the carrion crow, which I believe
is the exception that proves the rule. It is an astonishing sight
to witness the sudden arrival of vultures at the death of an
animal, when a few moments before not a bird has been in sight in
the cloudless sky. I have frequently lain down beneath a bush after
having shot an animal, to watch the arrival of the various species
of birds in regular succession; they invariably appear in the
following order:—</p>

<p>“No. 1, the black and white crow: this knowing individual is
most industrious is seeking for his food, and is generally to be
seen either perched upon rocks or upon trees; I believe he trusts
much to his sense of smell, as he is never far from the ground; at
the same time he keeps a vigilant look-out with a very sharp pair
of eyes.</p>

<p>“No. 2 is the common buzzard; this bird, so well known for its
extreme daring, is omnipresent, and trusts generally to sight, as
it will stoop at a piece of red cloth in mistake for flesh; thus
proving that it depends more upon vision than smell.</p>

<p>“No. 3 is the red-faced small vulture.</p>

<p>“No. 4 is the large bare-throated vulture.</p>

<p>“No. 5 the marabou stork, sometimes accompanied by the
adjutant.</p>

<p>“When employed in watching the habits of these birds it is
interesting to make the experiment of concealing a dead animal
beneath a dense bush. This I have frequently done; in which case
the vultures never find it unless they have witnessed its death; if
so, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span> will
already have pounced in their descent while you have been engaged
in concealing the body. They will then upon near approach discover
it by the smell. But, if an animal is killed in thick grass, eight
or ten feet high, the vultures will seldom discover it. I have
frequently known the bodies of large animals, such as elephants and
buffaloes, to lie for days beneath the shade of the dense nabbuk
bushes, unattended by a single vulture; whereas, if visible, they
would have been visited by these birds in thousands.</p>

<p>“Vultures and the marabou stork fly at enormous altitudes. I
believe that every species keeps to its own particular elevation,
and that the atmosphere contains regular strata of birds of prey,
who, invisible to the human eye at that enormous height, are
constantly resting upon their wide-spread wings, and, soaring in
circles, watching with telescopic sight the world beneath. At that
great elevation they are in an exceedingly cool temperature,
therefore they require no water; but some birds that make long
flights over arid deserts, such as the marabou stork and the
bustard, are provided with water-sacs; the former in an external
bag a little below the throat, the latter in an internal sac, both
of which carry a large supply. As the birds of prey that I have
enumerated invariably appear at a carcase in their regular
succession, I can only suggest that they travel from different
distances or altitudes. Thus, the marabou stork would be farthest
from the earth; the large bare-necked vulture would be the next
below him, followed by the red-faced vulture, the buzzard, and the
crow that is generally about the surface. From their immense
elevation, the birds of prey possess an extraordinary field of
vision; and, although they are invisible from the earth, there can
be no doubt that they are perpetually<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_128">[128]</span> hunting in circles within sight of each
other. Thus, should one bird discover some object upon the surface
of the earth below, his sudden pounce would be at once observed and
imitated by every vulture in succession. Should one vulture nearest
the earth perceive a body, or even should he notice the buzzards
collecting at a given point, he would at once become aware of a
prey; his rush towards the spot would act like a telegraphic signal
to others, that would be rapidly communicated to every vulture at
successive airy stations.</p>

<p>“If an animal be skinned, the red surface will attract the
vultures in an instant; this proves that their sight, and not their
scent, has been attracted by an object that suggests blood. I have
frequently watched them when I have shot an animal, and my people
have commenced the process of skinning. At first, not a bird has
been in sight, as I have lain on my back and gazed into the
spotless blue sky; but hardly has the skin been half withdrawn,
than specks have appeared in the heavens, rapidly increasing. ‘Caw,
caw,’ has been heard several times from the neighbouring bushes;
the buzzards have swept down close to my people, and have snatched
a morsel of clotted blood from the ground. The specks have
increased to winged creatures, at the great height resembling
flies, when presently a rushing sound behind me, like a whirlwind,
has been followed by the pounce of a red-faced vulture, that has
fallen from the heavens in haste with closed wings to the bloody
feast, followed quickly by many of his brethren. The sky has become
alive with black specks in the far distant blue, with wings
hurrying from all quarters. At length a coronet of steady soaring
vultures forms a wide circle far above, as they hesitate to
descend, but continue to revolve around the object of attraction.
The great bare-necked<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_129">[129]</span> vulture suddenly appears. The animal has
been skinned, and the required flesh secured by the men; we
withdraw a hundred paces from the scene. A general rush and descent
takes place; hundreds of hungry beaks are tearing at the offal. The
great bare-necked vulture claims respect among the crowd; but
another form has appeared in the blue sky, and rapidly descends. A
pair of long, ungainly legs, hanging down beneath the enormous
wings, now touch the ground, and Abou Seen (father of the teeth or
beak, the Arab name for the Marabou) has arrived, and he stalks
proudly towards the crowds, pecking his way with his long bill
through the struggling vultures, and swallowing the lion’s share of
the repast. Abou Seen, last but not least, had arrived from the
highest region, while others had the advantage of the start. This
bird is very numerous through the Nile tributaries of Abyssinia,
and may generally be seen perched upon the rocks of the waterside,
watching for small fish, or any reptile that may chance to come
within his reach. The well-known feathers are situated in a plume
beneath the tail.”<a id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81"
class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>On the night of January 23, the thermometer sank to 29° F. just
before sunrise, so no one turned out with alacrity, and we were
later than usual in starting.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find that the boy Zody sought to attach
himself to the expedition. While we were preparing to leave Korata
he came to us and said, “You are good people and I want to go with
you.” We raised no objection, and he joined our party. A little
while afterwards he declared his intention of accompanying us to
the Soudan. Thereupon he returned to Korata and “realized his
capital” by selling the cow which he possessed. Then he overtook
the expedition, and served<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_130">[130]</span> throughout the journey to Gallabat,
receiving the same pay as the other boys. He was smart, willing,
and useful, soon learned from his comrades what our requirements
were, and acted both as indoor and outdoor servant. He had no
Arabic, and all intercourse between us was by signs, which he was
extremely quick to understand. The motive that prompted him to
render us service was undoubtedly his devoted loyalty to
Crawley.</p>

<p>Most travellers have given the Habashes a thoroughly bad
character. It is said that they are vain, greedy, treacherous, and
cowardly. Though we Europeans had but few unpleasant experiences of
them while we were in the country, I cannot say that I saw anything
which would give me authority to dispute the conclusions of writers
who knew them better from longer observation, and it is the more
pleasant on this account to record an instance of an Abyssinian’s
fidelity and cheerful good-will.</p>

<p>We marched through the familiar dry grass for about half an hour
after we left Korata, and then reached the river Gelda at a place
where, according to the “tout,” it was fordable. This is a muddy,
rapid stream, flowing between earthy banks. Its bed here was soft
and yielding, and there was not the least possibility of getting
the beasts and baggage across. In fact, our guide had misled us. It
was a most annoying waste of time. While we were shooting on the
previous day we had seen a fording-place higher up the stream, and
now struck towards it in spite of the “tout’s” assertion that the
water there would be up to the men’s necks.</p>

<p>When we reached the spot, we found a shallow, fairly fast
current flowing over a rocky bed. The guide was entirely unabashed
by the fact that he had misdirected us and lied to us. After this
we ceased to consult natives and planned our course according to
Stecker’s map, and in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_131">[131]</span> this way managed the matter well enough.
There are some small inaccuracies in the doctor’s work, but it is
entirely sufficient for all practical purposes and a worthy record
of the German traveller’s high attainments and untiring
patience.</p>

<p>The ledges of rock which form the bed of the river at the upper
ford are smooth and round, and in consequence very slippery. We had
a busy time getting the donkeys over. Men had to be posted in the
water to steady them as they crossed, but the real trouble was at
the further bank. It was high and steep, and the way up was by a
narrow cutting with a hard surface. The first wet donkey that
passed along this made it as insecure for foothold as a slide, and
the next donkey struggled and scrambled and fell back into the
water. We had to tell off boys to shovel relays of earth on to the
slope and then others grabbed the donkey’s load, its ear, its tail,
or anything they could get a grip of, and shoved it up bodily.
Another detachment was on duty on the top of the bank to prevent
the animals from straying.</p>

<p>Beyond the river lies a steep hill about five hundred feet high.
The ascent is by a track of the usual kind, about a foot and a half
wide. The way down from the summit is very precipitous and was full
of loose stones. These the donkeys often dislodged, and many rolled
along and struck the animals that were moving in front, but we had
no trouble with them.</p>

<p>We passed a village which is called Selselima, consisting of the
usual tokhuls grouped about a round thatched church. Here I saw an
example of Abyssinian methods of administration. A lad of about
eighteen was standing in a field, watching us pass. Ras Gouksha’s
man, the “tout,” went up to him, grabbed him by his<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> gown, and began to question
him. Soon another Abyssinian approached him, grasped the boy’s
<em>shama</em> in like manner, and also interrogated him. I
inquired what they were asking, and was told they were seeking
directions to guide them by the nearest way to the source of the
Blue Nile, which was then some four miles distant. Presently
without apparent reason, both our fellows began to belabour the lad
with their staves. I rode up and ordered them sharply to desist,
and explain to me what they were about. Thereupon they made off,
and one of our escort told me they had been beating the boy so as
to force him to act as their guide—without pay, of course—and
accompany them to the river, though he had already given them full
directions for the road.</p>

<p>The end of the descent brought us to the lake shore again, and
we camped on the further bank of a little stream of clear water
running in a rocky bed. It is called the Tschembolo. This is near
to the village of Woreb, and is only two miles from the point where
the Blue Nile flows from Lake Tsana. We could not proceed further
that day, for the march had been a long one, and it was late
already. So we halted upon this spot by the brook, as it was a very
suitable camping-ground with a clean drinking supply, and
determined to move on the morrow to a more central position, if we
could find one, for the survey work which Crawley and Dupuis were
to undertake.</p>

<p>Patients had followed me from Korata. They were people who had
reached our camp there in the morning, after I had packed up the
medicine-chest and mounted my mule. Some half a dozen had come over
to Woreb after us, and were now waiting to see me. But I was dead
tired that evening and refused to attend to them.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> There were no serious cases,
and I told those who wished to have advice to return at nine
o’clock the next morning. If I had made myself more accessible than
I was, I should have been mobbed not only by the sick in Abyssinia,
but by a host of people who fancied they had ailments.</p>

</div>

<p>Just before dinner there was a commotion close to our tents, and
we found that one of the soldiers of our escort had tried to stab
Walda Mariam,<a id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class=
"fnanchor">[82]</a> the assistant of Johannes, with whom he had
come to meet us at Gallabat. We immediately disarmed the soldier,
and then discovered that both had been to a village near by to get
<em>tedj</em>, and were drunk. So we disarmed the
deputy-interpreter also, and I was sorry to see him in disgrace,
for he had always been willing, hard-working, and cheery on the
journey. We placed the soldier under arrest, and warned him that if
he were found brawling again he would be flogged. Then, order being
restored, we went to dinner.</p>

<p>In this part of Abyssinia the mountain air sharpened our
appetites, and I must own that we were sturdy trenchermen. Each
would tackle a whole guinea-fowl or duck for lunch, and be ready
for another in the evening. We had puddings “of sorts” too, and
yet, like Oliver Twist, we “asked for more.”</p>

<p>On the morning of January 26, the quarrelsome soldier, now sober
and crestfallen, was brought up for a formal reprimand. He was told
that his case would be reported at Gallabat, and that he would be
punished there according to military law. Then his arms were
returned to him. Walda Mariam also attended, looking sheepish and
sorry for himself, and his weapons too were restored to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>After this the
medicine-chest was unloaded, and I redeemed my promise to patients.
One family—father, mother, and two children—had come from a
distance to consult me at Korata. They had arrived too late, and
had followed us to Woreb. The father was suffering from necrosis of
the lower jaw, and I had to draw three teeth for him. The mother
had come to hear what instructions were given about the children—a
little boy and a little girl. They were suffering from strumous,
tuberculous glands of the neck. I had as “hospital orderly” a
soldier who understood Arabic and Amharic, and could therefore put
me <i>en rapport</i> with my patients. After an examination of the
children, I concluded that the right thing would be an operation
with the knife. I told this to the woman, and the soldier
interpreted what I said word for word. As soon as the little girl
heard the word “knife,” she gave vent to the loudest, most piercing
scream that she could utter, and fairly flew from the spot. The
noise created a sensation among the Habashes and boys, who seemed
to think that I was killing a patient. It would have been awkward
in any case to operate in camp, and on this occasion I had no
opportunity. Nothing short of brute force would have brought the
little girl back, and I think the word “knife” conveyed to her
mother and brother the notion of the butcher’s rather than the
surgeon’s implement.</p>

<p>My companions had mounted their mules and started on an
exploring journey, intending to select a good site as a
camping-ground close to the river. But by the time they returned
they had decided that our present position could not be bettered,
as the river-banks were low ground covered with papyrus swamps, and
any halting-place there would be very unhealthy. They
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> also found that
all the points from which they wished to make observations were
easy of access from the spot that we had chosen.</p>

<p>I had a rather sharp touch of fever in the afternoon, and was
obliged to give up work and lie down. These attacks are unavoidable
at times in that country. They make one feel extremely helpless and
depressed while they last, but soon yield to quinine and a little
rest.</p>

<p>The next morning, January 26, I was better, but felt shaky when
I got on my mule and started with my companions. At a short
distance from the camp we left the animals in a hollow and climbed
a steep hill about five hundred feet high. It was covered with tall
grass and the soil was stony, so that I was soon out of breath. But
when we reached the summit a lovely scene lay in front of us. The
Blue Nile, winding away from its outlet in the lake, was bright in
the sunshine. The green banks on either side were delightful to the
eyes, and here and there in the stream were little islands, vivid
in colour, where the papyrus grew to a height of twelve or fourteen
feet. There were many dark dots in the water—heads of hippopotami,
which swarm in these upper reaches of the Blue Nile. Mountains rise
above the river-valley on both sides, and the stream curves among
the spurs at their base, till it is lost to sight. The view from
the high land is far-reaching, and the clearness of the air makes
even distant outlines very distinct. I can scarcely imagine a scene
at once so charming, tranquil, and impressive as this prospect of
lake, river, and mountains. It is impossible to convey in words the
effect of the simple, strong colouring—the blue lake, the flashing
stream, the verdurous islands and swamps, the cloudless, lustrous
sky, the chromes and grays and purplish<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_136">[136]</span> shadows among the ridges that sweep upward
and recede from the valley in splendid lines. And upon the peace of
this landscape at least, the personally conducted tripper will not
intrude just yet.</p>

<p>I noticed several cataracts, but none of any great extent. The
water in these rapids was rushing over and between rocks, and they
must be ugly places when the lake rises. In other parts the river
was smooth and still. In one pool we counted eighteen hippos taking
the air, just their snouts being out of water.</p>

<p>Almost at once we set to work and piled up a heap of stones, and
fixed in the centre of it a long pole as a landmark. This was a
straight, thin branch which we cut from a tree near at hand. After
this we set up three more “cairns” on selected spots, and then
descended to the low ground, where the mules were waiting. I
remained in the valley, for exertion soon tires one out after the
fever. My friends climbed other hills and erected more landmarks
before returning to lunch. In the meanwhile I tried my luck at
angling in the river, but caught nothing, and soon gave up the
attempt, and lounged under a palm-tree, reading.</p>

<p>My companions started on their mules after lunch to continue
their survey, and I went back to camp and was glad to be idle. The
day’s work was ended before evening, and I believe we were the
first Britishers who had five-o’clock tea beside the head waters of
the Blue Nile.</p>

<p>Next morning (January 27) I had instructions to set up a
stone-heap on a little hill about four miles from camp. I made my
way to it direct through a tangle of jungle-growths, and from the
summit obtained the photograph of the source of the river at the
point of outflow from the lake which forms the frontispiece
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> this book. I
believe this to be the only photo of the place in existence.</p>

<p>I descended the hill, and walked along the riverbank towards the
place where we had arranged to lunch. The soil was boggy, covered
in some parts by reed-grass and in others by jungle-growths. Hippo
spoor was everywhere. This tract is not well-wooded; there are a
few palms, and some scattered trees of other kinds, chiefly
mimosas. The bed of the river is hard rock, and the water was clear
and drinkable. The depth varied very greatly, from a few inches in
the rapids to some six metres in the pools. I saw the stream at its
lowest. Watermarks showed clearly that in flood time it rises
sixteen to eighteen feet above this level.</p>

<p>When I reached the place where we were to lunch, I saw a big
herd of hippos basking on the surface of the river. Crawley and I
walked towards them, and when they saw us, they sank, leaving only
their snouts visible. These offered an interesting target for
rifle-fire, and for awhile the hippos watched our practice with
unconcern. Then a shot told—there was a “general post”—and not a
sign of the huge beasts remained in sight.</p>

<p>After this I took my rod and tried for a fish in a pool below a
rapid. While I was standing there, I saw a large white eagle, a
splendid fellow, which had been watching me fishing, swoop from the
branch of a high tree. He circled twice above me, and then pounced
upon a young duck, that was hiding under a ledge in the river-bed,
and bore it off. The parent birds were close at hand, and I heard
their loud, frightened, and indignant cackling. I do not think wild
duck are plentiful hereabouts. No doubt they are harried by these
eagles and have to find safer breeding-places.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_138">[138]</span> We saw only a very few. I landed a plump
fish of the perch tribe, which weighed about four pounds. He showed
no fight, but came tamely into shallow water, where the boy who was
with me picked him up. My friends came late into camp after a hard
day’s work upon their survey.</p>

<p>The high ground beside the head waters of the Blue Nile is
pleasant and healthy and could support a large population. The
maximum temperature in the day, when we were there, was about
eighty-five degrees. Usually a cool, exhilarating breeze was
blowing, and we did not feel the heat disagreeably. If this place
were more easily accessible, it would be a perfect pleasure-resort
and a most valuable sanatorium for residents in the Soudan.</p>

<p>The event of January 28, was the appearance of potatoes at
table. I had often gazed at this unvarying factor in one’s diet
with indifference if not slightingly, and had wondered why the
things were served so constantly at European tables. It was not
till we missed the daily luxury that we appreciated it. The roast
fowl was another bird with this accompaniment. These were the only
potatoes that we saw in Abyssinia; they were very small. The cook
had discovered them in a remote hamlet. I can offer no explanation
of their presence in that place. He purchased a sackful for one
salt and an empty lime-juice bottle, and returned to camp in
triumph, shouting at the top of his voice that he had found
“batatas” at last. Perhaps as he failed to discover any more, the
expedition denuded the country of its whole stock.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span><a id=
"c10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">On</span> January 29 my companions
and I started early for the little hill beside the river on which I
had set up a “cairn” the day before. This is the first rising
ground beyond the outlet of the Blue Nile. (It ought to be named
after some kingly, heroic, half-divine figure that looms in the
dawn of legend, but—with my modest compliments to future
geographers—it has since been called Hayes’s Hill.)</p>

<p>At the foot of it, just below the first cataract in the stream,
is a ferry. It is a primordial means of transit into Godjam. Two
men are in charge of a papyrus boat which they paddle across, using
a pole in the manner of a canoe-paddle, as the water is too deep
for punting. At this spot Dupuis had some survey work in hand which
involved taking a rope to the opposite bank. Our Berthon boat had
been brought down to the riverside, and Crawley and I rowed over
towing the line astern and made it fast to a tree. Crawley
returned, and I remained at leisure in Godjam and used my camera
and fishing-rod to wile away the time.</p>

<p>I saw some natives using a net like a seine in the shallow water
just below the rapids. They had some very fair catches, and among
the fishes which they hauled ashore I noticed in particular one of
a blue colour which had what appeared to me to be a red<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> sucker on its snout. I have no
idea to what species it belonged.</p>

<p>My friends finished their mapping about one o’clock, and then we
lunched in the shade of a mimosa. While we sat there we had an
opportunity of watching the Habashes’ method of getting donkeys
across the stream. They were pushed into the water, then four to
six men would scramble on to the crazy <em>tankoa</em>, which
looked as if it must sink under their weight. Each man would now
seize a donkey by the ear, and then the boat would start guided by
the old ferryman in the stern. Thus the donkeys had to swim
alongside the raft—it is no more than that—and as their heads were
held above water, they could scarcely come to harm.</p>

<p>We saw that it would save us much time and trouble if our beasts
were towed across in this way, and, after some deliberation, we
asked the ferryman what his charge would be for transporting
seventy donkeys. He replied that he would do it for seven dollars.
This, on consideration, seemed a fair bargain, and we resolved to
make an early start on the following day. The baggage was to go
over in our own boat, which could be hauled across by means of a
line made fast on both banks.</p>

<p>After concluding this arrangement we went back to camp, carrying
the rope with us. It might have tempted Charon—I don’t know his
Abyssinian name—if we had left it. We had sent Walda Mariam as an
envoy to King Tecla Haimanot, whose lands we should enter after
crossing the river. The king was in residence not far off, and in
the evening our man returned with a satisfactory message giving us
all necessary permission. The jurisdiction of Tecla Haimanot
extended only ten or twelve miles northward beside the lake, and we
found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> that we
should have to obtain the consent of Ras Mangousha, whose dominions
march here with those of the King of Godjam, before we could
complete the circuit of the lake.</p>

<p>We made an early start on the morning of the 30th. I went to the
ferry and had our Berthon boat put together. We found that our plan
answered excellently. Our boat, loaded with baggage, was easily
hauled over, and by a quarter to ten half a score of donkeys had
been carried across in tow of the ferrymen’s <em>tankoa</em>. Some
of the boys would put their arms under a donkey and lift it bodily
into place by the ferryboat at the starting-point, where the water
was shallow. It was a scrambling, pushing, splashing business, and
they thoroughly enjoyed standing in the stream and basking in the
sunshine. A number of Habashes from Woreb helped, and our crossing
was a merry, pleasant scene. The mules did not go “by ferry,” but
swam over with men beside them, as at other deep water passages. It
was all done and we had landed in Godjam without mishap of any kind
by a quarter-past one. The last load that I took over in our boat
consisted of nine of our men, rather more passengers, I fancy, than
I was “licensed to carry.” We scrambled up some rocks on the
further side, and then found ourselves on level ground, where
travelling would be easy.</p>

<p>Fully half of the donkeys had been reloaded by the time we
finished lunch, and we moved ahead with this detachment. The
country on the further side of the Nile seemed to me to be in a
more prosperous state. There was more cultivation of dhurra and
grain. The natives were fatter and looked, by comparison,
“well-to-do.” I heard afterwards that the ruler here is not
so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> extortionate as
certain other chieftains. I believe that we were the first
Europeans to traverse this part of Godjam.</p>

<p>After a journey of three-quarters of an hour we approached the
village of Bahardar Georgis. Before entering the hamlet we had to
conform to a singular usage. Two men had stationed themselves
beside the track, one on each side of it, and they held a
<em>shama</em> across it. We asked Johannes what this meant, and he
told us that it was to protect the villagers from the power of the
“evil eye.” This is lost if the stranger who may possess it passes
under the <em>shama</em>. We had to move the greasy robe aside and
go beneath it, hoping rather than believing that it was not
verminous. The Habashes are extremely superstitious in this
respect. It is customary to screen a person of rank with a shama
when he drinks, to safeguard him from the same peril, and such
persons are frequently kept from view likewise while they eat their
meals. Mr. Hormuzd Rassam, being a high dignitary, was carefully
shielded in this way to his no slight disgust. He wrote: “As the
generality of the garments spread out for our seclusion had not
been washed for months, and probably not since they were first
worn, the reader’s imagination may be left to conceive the odour
which surrounded us on these occasions. But even if they had been
washed no later than the previous day, the disagreeable smell of
rancid butter with which the natives besmear their heads would
suffice to render any such curtain almost intolerable.”<a id=
"FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class=
"fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>We had to use care in the selection of our camping-ground near
Bahardar Georgis. Much of the ground is covered by the papyrus
plant, and this shows<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_143">[143]</span> dampness and, by consequence, risk of
fever. We finally selected a spot on some high ground, where there
was a dry, red soil. This happened to be close to a little
settlement of the curious people called <em>Waitos</em>, who are
only found in this district. They inhabited two or three huts near
the village. Mr. Rassam has given a concise and interesting account
of them: “The Waitos are Mussulmans of the Maliky sect, and
although Mohammedanism recognizes no castes among its adherents,
nevertheless these people, who subsist upon the flesh of the
hippopotamus” (which is considered unclean by all other
Abyssinians), “are looked down upon by their co-religionists, who
consider it a degradation to associate with them. A few among them
cultivate a little grain, but the flesh of the hippopotamus forms
their staple food. . . . I was unable to obtain any satisfactory
account of the origin of this peculiar people. It is just possible,
however, that there may be some relationship between them and the
<em>Watos</em>, a tribe of Gallas inhabiting the banks of the
Hawash, south of Shoa, who are also said to live on the flesh of
the hippopotamus.”<a id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84"
class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Stecker, who was scrupulously accurate in
almost every particular which he mentioned, said that the
<em>Waitos</em> were, “strictly speaking, a Pagan sect
(<em>eigentlich Heiden-secte</em>)”<a id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> but in this he was
mistaken. Oddly enough, these people, though they are, in a sense,
outcasts, are exclusive, and proud of their isolation.</p>

<p>On the morning of January 31 my companions took the Berthon boat
and a whole cargo of surveyors’ gear, and started to complete the
work for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> the
expedition had been organized. A full account of the results will
be found in Sir William Garstin’s official Report on the Sources of
the Nile. My services were not requested, and I certainly have had
more practice in surveying symptoms than ground. I stayed in camp
for awhile, and then walked to the river with angling-tackle, and
landed a fair-sized fish with a spoon-bait. It was of the perch
family.</p>

<p>The country around Bahardar Georgis is flat, as I have said, and
in places swampy. The marshy tracts are overgrown by papyrus, and
it is not easy to distinguish them before one is both on and in
them. On this moist ground we saw flocks of wild geese and various
species of ibis. In the neighbourhood of the village I first
observed the bird known as <i>buphaga Africana</i>. It pitched upon
the backs of any of our donkeys that had sores, and caught the
flies that settled there. The bodies of these birds are gray, and
scarcely distinguishable from the donkey’s hide. Their beaks are
red, and, at a little distance, I noticed that they exactly
resembled a sore on the beasts which they infested. This colouring
seems a remarkable example of evolution in the direction of
“protective mimicry.” They worry cattle also, and it is well known
that they peck the animals to make raw places, which then attract
the flies that are caught upon them. I believe that they also use
their beaks to mimic sores, for my attention was first drawn to the
birds by the semblance of abrasions on the spinal area of some of
the donkeys, where I knew that none existed. No doubt the beaks,
used thus, are a successful trap.</p>

<p>During the day I received a visit from an Abyssinian artist who
lived at Bahardar Georgis. He came to beg colours from us, if we
had any; I have no notion how<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_145">[145]</span> the Habashes compound their pigments. He
told me that he had a commission to execute some paintings for the
church. I could only give him some pieces of red and blue pencil.
He was extremely grateful for these, and bestowed upon me some
samples of his art.</p>

<p>I presented him to Dupuis, who was greatly interested by his
pictures, and kindly took the trouble to discover, after much
rummaging, an old box of paints. This he gave to the youth, whose
delight was indescribable. He promised Dupuis works of art in his
best style. In the evening he came to our camp again, and I showed
him the Christmas Number of <em>Pearson’s Magazine</em>. This
pleased him highly, especially when he found that he was to be the
possessor of it. The three coloured plates caused him an ecstasy of
wonder and pleasure, and the respective artists—and the
colour-printers—have a venerating admirer by the lake-side.</p>

<p>My friends returned to camp rather later than they had expected,
but were well pleased by the result of the day’s work. They found
that at this season of the year the discharge from the lake into
the river was at the rate of forty-two cubic metres to the second.
And they brought some guinea-fowl to the larder. The future
proprietor of the Blue Nile Hotel and pension on Lake Tsana will
always be able to offer his guests fish and poultry.</p>

<p>On February 1 my companions started on foot, accompanied by
Johannes, a pack-mule and some boys, to see the first falls in the
course of the Blue Nile, and the ancient stone bridge which spans
the river at this point.<a id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> These falls are twenty-one
miles below the outlet of the stream from the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>I remained in
charge of the camp, and, to wile away the time, took our boat out
upon the lake. This caused a great sensation among the villagers,
who had seen nothing of my friends’ excursion in it the previous
day. The Habashes flocked to the edge of the water, but whenever I
rested on the oars for a few moments, they rushed screaming into
their huts. Apparently they regarded me as a naval force, and
thought I meant to carry Bahardar Georgis by a <i>coup de main</i>.
Perhaps they remembered King Theodore’s descent upon the island of
Dek. “He was in pursuit, it appears, of a refractory chief under
Ras Ali, who had taken refuge on the island. In less than
twenty-four hours he had two hundred canoes constructed, in which
he suddenly appeared off the place with five hundred chosen
warriors.”<a id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class=
"fnanchor">[87]</a> I should think that this was the only occasion
on which the <em>tankoa</em> was used in war, and have a feeling of
compassion for the five hundred warriors.</p>

<p>We noticed that at this place the children seemed especially
frightened of white men. Perhaps their mothers used us as bogeys to
terrify those that were troublesome. We found that we could soon
regain the confidence of the people by giving them any little
picture, no matter of what; prints from advertisements of furniture
or clothes served quite well. They received these with delight.</p>

<p>On the next day (February 2) my friends returned to camp, having
made short work of their tramp of forty-two miles. Crawley had shot
an oribi, a species of gazelle, on the way to the falls, and Dupuis
secured one on the march back. The former had served as
tasty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span> rations to
the party on the journey, the latter came into our larder, and the
prospect of venison after a long course of guinea-fowl was very
pleasant.</p>

<p>They had met a small body of Habashes on the road, who attempted
to turn them back, and these men loaded their rifles as a menace.
They were probably soldiers of the King of Godjam, but as the
Abyssinian troops wear no uniform it is difficult to distinguish
those who are “in the service” from those who are not. As among the
Boers, the combatant can at any time become a non-combatant if he
has time to hide his rifle and cartridges. My friends took no
notice of the hostile demonstration and rode on. Nothing came of
it. Probably the threat was intended to extort money. Usually we
were well received, and I attribute this to the sound judgment of
our chief, who took care to leave the villages near which we camped
a little richer than we found them.</p>

<p>The bridge is a most interesting relic of the times of
Portuguese ascendency in Abyssinia. I am indebted to Dupuis for
permission to reproduce his photograph of it. The following account
of its construction is taken from Dr. Johnson’s translation of
Father Jerome Lobo’s<a id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88"
class="fnanchor">[88]</a> “Voyage to Abyssinia.” I quote the
passage <i>in extenso</i> because it contains a reference to a
question which has been much discussed, though it has merely an
academic interest, viz. whether Lake Tsana, or the river which is
its principal tributary, should be regarded as the true source of
the Blue Nile.</p>

<p>“The Nile, which the natives call Abavi” (Abai), “that is the
father of waters, rises first in Sacala, a province of the kingdom
of Goiama” (Godjam), “which is one of the most fruitful and
agreeable of all the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_148">[148]</span> Abyssinian dominions. This province is
inhabited by a nation of the Agaus, who call themselves Christians,
but by daily intermarriages they have allied themselves to the
Pagan Agaus, and adopted all their customs and ceremonies. These
two nations are very numerous, fierce, and unconquerable,
inhabiting a country full of mountains, which are covered with
woods, and hollowed by nature into vast caverns, many of which are
capable of containing several numerous families and hundreds of
cows. To these recesses the Agaus betake themselves when they are
driven out of the plain, where it is almost impossible to find them
and certain ruin to pursue them. This people increases extremely,
every man being allowed so many wives as he hath hundreds of cows;
and it is seldom that the hundreds are required to be complete.</p>

<p>“In the eastern part of this kingdom, on the declivity of a
mountain, whose descent is so easy that it seems a beautiful plain,
is that source of the Nile which has been sought after at so much
expense of labour, and about which such variety of conjectures hath
been formed without success. This spring, or rather these two
springs, are two holes, each about two feet diameter, a stone’s
cast distant from each other. The one is but about five feet and a
half in depth, at least we could not get our plummet farther,
perhaps because it was stopped by roots, for the whole place is
full of trees. Of the other, which is somewhat less, with a line of
ten feet we could find no bottom, and were assured by the
inhabitants that none ever had been found. It is believed here that
these springs are the vent of a great subterraneous lake; and they
have this circumstance to favour their opinion, that the ground is
always moist, and so soft that the water boils up underfoot as one
walks upon it:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> this
is more visible after rains, for then the ground yields and sinks
so much, that I believe it is chiefly supported by the roots of
trees that are interwoven one with another. Such is the ground
round about these fountains. At a little distance to the south is a
village named Guix, through which the way lies to the top of the
mountain, from whence the traveller discovers a vast extent of
land, which appears like a deep valley, though the mountain rises
so imperceptibly that those who go up or down it are scarce
sensible of any declivity.</p>

<p>“On the top of this mountain is a little hill, which the
idolatrous Agaus have in great veneration. Their priest calls them
together at this place once a year; and having sacrificed a cow,
throws the head into one of the springs of the Nile; after which
ceremony every one sacrifices a cow or more according to their
different degrees of wealth or devotion. The bones of these cows
have already formed two mountains of considerable height, which
afford a sufficient proof that these nations have always paid their
adorations to this famous river. They eat these sacrifices with
great devotion, as flesh consecrated to their deity. Then the
priest anoints himself with the grease and tallow of the cows, and
sits down on a heap of straw on the top and in the middle of a pile
which is prepared. They set fire to it, and the whole heap is
consumed without any injury to the priest; who, while the fire
continues, harangues the standers by, and confirms them in their
present ignorance and superstition. When the pile is burnt, and the
discourse at an end, every one makes a large present to the priest,
which is the grand design of this religious mockery.</p>

<p>“To return to the course of the Nile. Its waters, after the
first rise, run to the eastward for about a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_150">[150]</span> musket-shot; then turning to the north,
continue hidden in the grass and weeds for about a quarter of a
league, and discover themselves for the first time among some
rocks; a sight not to be enjoyed without some pleasure by those who
have read the fabulous accounts of this stream delivered by the
ancients, and the vain conjectures and reasonings which have been
formed upon its original, the nature of its water, its cataracts,
and its inundations, all which we are now entirely acquainted with,
and eye witnesses of.”<a id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The Nile “rolls away from its source with so inconsiderable a
current that it appears unlikely to escape being dried up by the
hot season, but soon receiving an increase from the Gemma, the
Kelta, the Bransu, and other less rivers, it is of such a breadth
in the plain of Boad, which is not above three days’ journey from
its source, that a ball shot from a musket will scarce fly from one
bank to the other. Here it begins to run northward, deflecting,
however, a little towards the east, for the space of nine or ten
leagues; and then enters the so much talked of lake of Dambia”
(Tsana), “called by the natives Barhar Sena, the resemblance of the
sea, or Barhar Dambia, the sea of Dambia. It crosses this lake only
at one end, with so violent a rapidity that the waves of the Nile”
(Abai) “may be distinguished through all the passage, which is six
leagues.<a id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class=
"fnanchor">[90]</a> Here begins the greatness of the
Nile.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span> Fifteen miles
farther, in the land of Alata, it rushes precipitately from the top
of a high rock, and forms one of the most beautiful waterfalls in
the world. I passed under it without being wet, and resting myself
there for the sake of the coolness, was charmed with a thousand
delightful rainbows which the sunbeams painted on the water in all
their shining and lively colours. The fall of this mighty stream,
from so great a height, makes a noise that may be heard to a
considerable distance. . . . The mist that rises from this fall of
water may be seen much farther than the noise can be heard. After
this cataract, the Nile again collects its scattered stream among
the rocks which seem to be disjoined in this place only to afford
it a passage. They are so near each other, that, in my time, a
bridge of beams, on which the whole Imperial army passed, was laid
over them. Sultan Segued<a id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> hath since built here a
bridge of one arch in the same place, for which purpose he procured
masons from India” (<i>i.e.</i> the Portuguese Indies).<a id=
"FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
“This bridge, which is the first the Abyssinians have seen on the
Nile, very much facilitates a communication between the provinces,
and encourages commerce among the inhabitants of his Empire.”</p>

<p>Bruce’s description of the source of the Abai differs somewhat
from that given by Father Lobo. It is brief,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_152">[152]</span> and as an exceptional interest attaches
to the spot, it may not be superfluous to quote it.</p>

<p>“Half undressed as I was, by loss of my sash, and throwing my
shoes off” (as he had been directed to do in order to conform to a
superstitious usage of the natives), “I ran down the hill towards
the little island of green sods, which was about two hundred yards
distant; the whole side of the hill was thick grown with flowers,
the large bulbous roots<a id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> of which appearing above
the surface of the ground, and their skins coming off upon treading
upon them, occasioned me two very severe falls before I reached the
brink of the marsh. I after this came to the altar of green turf,
which was in form of an altar apparently the work of art, and I
stood in rapture over the principal fountain, which rises in the
middle of it.”<a id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class=
"fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Bruce talked with “the Shum, the priest of the river, whose
title was Kefla Abai, or ‘Servant of the river.’ He was a man of
about seventy. The honourable charge which he possessed had been in
his family, he conceived, from the beginning of the world; and as
he was the happy father of eighty-four children, it appeared that
his race was likely to flow as long as the Nile itself. He had a
long white beard; round his body was wrapped a skin, which was
fastened by a broad belt. Over this he wore a cloak, the hood of
which covered his head, his legs were bare, but he wore sandals,
which he threw off as soon as he approached the bog from which the
Nile” (Abai) “rises—a mark of respect which Bruce and his
attendants were also<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_153">[153]</span> required to perform.” The Shum very
obligingly presented his comely and sprightly daughter Irepone,
aged sixteen, to the Scottish traveller as housekeeper.</p>

<p>Bruce says that at this time the people of the place called the
Spirit of the River “The Everlasting God, Light of the World, Eye
of the World, God of Peace, Saviour and Father of the Universe.” He
asked the Shum if he had ever seen the Spirit, and the old man
answered without hesitation, “Yes, very frequently.”<a id=
"FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class=
"fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The Abai mentioned above is the main tributary of the Blue Nile,
but a glance at the map will show that Lake Tsana receives many
other rivers, and the surrounding mountains, of course, add the
volume of innumerable torrents and small streams to its waters in
the rainy season. For practical purposes the source of the Blue
Nile is the lake fed by all the affluents which collectively
determine the amount of the discharge into the river.</p>

<p>To return to the camp at Bahardar Georgis. The survey work of
the expedition was now completed, and our subsequent stages were
upon the homeward journey. On February 3 we visited the village
church. I obtained a clear photograph of some of the paintings in
the interior. Unfortunately, as I am no archæologist, I cannot
pretend to say whether the clothing of St. George, either in his
combat or his victorious return, or the conception of the other
figures, gives an indication of the origin of the Abyssinian school
of ecclesiastical art. I hope that some of my readers who are
better informed may be able to throw light upon the subject. It is,
perhaps, of considerable interest for the following reason: If the
usages of the Abyssinian church, which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_154">[154]</span> is strictly conservative, represent a
really primitive form of Christianity, they show that the
observance of ritual ceremonies was, in the early days, at least as
much a matter of concern as the condition of the individual
conscience. And the style of the Abyssinian pictures of sacred
subjects may help to determine the date when the accepted liturgy
took its present form.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the guns of the party added some venison,
poultry, and game to the larder, and in the evening we were
serenaded—against our will and at our expense. A band of singers
and dancers from the village—both men and women—came into camp.
They had no intention of showing their skill without remuneration,
and as it would have caused ill-will among them and disappointment
to our own boys and escort if we had sent them away, we endured
their performance and paid for it. One of the instruments which
they use is a piece of board, over which strings are stretched, so
that it looks like a rude archaic forerunner of the violin. They
twang the strings with their fingers, but do not “stop” them to
obtain different notes from the same string. Our troupe also played
the tomtom and sang in the high nasal voice which is characteristic
of the race. We heard the last of them, thankfully, at half-past
nine.</p>

<p>While we were at Bahardar Georgis, the Waitos near our camp
drove a brisk trade in courbashes.<a id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> I bought of them some
hippo tusks, which they were glad to sell, as they live in great
poverty. If I had had some more small change (salt) I could have
purchased a quite considerable stock.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>Insects are an
annoying pest in this part of the lake side. Hosts of mosquitoes
and small beetles of a peculiar species appeared on the flat ground
at sunset, and swarmed throughout the neighbourhood for an hour
afterwards. The beetles settled upon us in throngs, and crawled
into our noses and ears and under our clothes, and we could not
even crush them on account of the unendurable smell which their
bodies then gave forth. When the first hour after sundown is past,
the temperature falls very rapidly, and one sees no more of these
insects.</p>

<p>On February 4 we started to complete the circuit of the lake and
reach Delgi by way of the Zegi peninsula. Our road lay across flat
land, bordered by marshes and full of swamps and quagmires.
Sometimes the marshes stretch a long way into the land, and long
detours had to be made to avoid them. I saw yams for the first time
in Abyssinia growing just above the swampy tracts in this region.
We had to cross three rivers with rocky beds, which were made
rougher and more slippery by loose stones. To add to our
difficulties, our guide twice led us out of the right path, and
once to a ford which was impassable for the donkeys. In this way we
lost nearly three hours. At lunch time we sent the baggage-train on
ahead of us. The latter part of the journey was over a beaten
track, and gave us no trouble. We overtook the baggage animals and
their escort just as they entered the undulating ground which forms
the approach to the peninsula of Zegi. We pitched our camp near the
shore of a little bay of which this promontory was the further
boundary.</p>

<p>While we were on the road I received a scribbled note from
Crawley, who told me that one of his soldiers was ill, had lain
down and refused to move.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_156">[156]</span> I rode back at his request, and found the
invalid under a tree. He said, “Leave me alone. I want to die.” It
was evident at a glance that he was suffering from ague. The only
remedy which we had at hand was chartreuse. I gave him a big “nip”
of the cordial, and it had an excellent effect upon him. He was
able to ride to the end of the journey, and was none the worse for
the effort. I venture to commend this incident to the consideration
of strict teetotalers.</p>

<p>The village near which we were encamped is that which is marked
as Furje on Stecker’s map. The district affords a curious example
of feudal tenure in Abyssinia. We had quitted Tecla Haimanot’s
dominions, and the land on which our camp stood was under the
control of a certain chief called Fituari<a id=
"FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Ali, a feudatory of Ras Mangousha. He dwelt close to the town of
Zegi, but had no jurisdiction within its boundary, though his
lordship was valid in a region extending beyond the town to the
Abai.</p>

<p>The chieftain had gone to attend the marriage of Ras Mangousha’s
daughter, and had left his son in authority. So we sent a messenger
with an escort to carry the news of our arrival to this young
Habash with due formality. He brought back an uncivil reply to the
effect that the Fituari’s son was absent, and if we wanted anything
we had better go and find him. This was sent by his majordomo.
While we were waiting for tea to be served, Johannes reported that
the young Habash was approaching, and we saw him at a little
distance attended by a band of followers, some of whom carried
guns. Our interpreter asked what he should say to this truculent
young man, and we bade him<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_157">[157]</span> explain that we only asked leave to pass
through the land, and should require nothing unless it were to
purchase a little grain for our animals. We always sought to avoid
trouble with the natives, and therefore impressed upon Johannes
that he should show we wished to be friendly, and say we hoped the
Fituari’s son would come and have a drink with us.</p>

<p>Johannes departed with his message, and presently we heard a
great hubbub—many Habashes talking at once at the top of their
high-pitched voices. We wondered what gave rise to so much
excitement. Presently Johannes emerged from the crowd and
approached us slowly. The young man’s answer was that he would
speak with us when he had seen the King’s letter. Now, this permit
and all our credentials had been dispatched on February 1 from
Bahardar Georgis to Ras Mangousha that we might obtain his leave to
travel through his territories beyond the Abai, and we did not
expect our messenger to return until late on the following day.</p>

<p>It was an uncomfortable situation. The Ras’s reply might be
unfavourable. In that case we should be confronted by the necessity
of retracing our steps over the whole of the toilsome journey by
the lake side. We all longed to kick the tiresome coxcomb who was
in our way, and went to dinner in a glum mood.</p>

<p>We were obliged to spend the following day (Feb. 5) in inaction
awaiting the return of our messenger with Ras Mangousha’s answer. I
busied myself with the camera, having every reason to believe that
no photographs of this tract of country had ever been taken.</p>

<p>During the morning we received a visit from the head man of
Zegi. We thought it a favourable sign that he gave us a very
pleasant and courteous welcome. This young man, Hyli by name, was
about nineteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
years of age. I learned afterwards that he was studying the ancient
Geez language under the tuition of the priests of Zegi, and presume
that he intended to “go into the Church.” These candidates for
orders are not permitted to smoke or drink strong liquor while they
are <i>in statu pupillari</i>. A similar restriction would scarcely
be popular in our own ancient universities.</p>

<p>Hyli, we found, had a large consignment of coffee to send to the
market at Gallabat. It is his business to collect the dues payable
on this produce before it leaves the village, and the revenue so
obtained is handed to Ras Mangousha. Hyli had now come to request
that his caravan might join ours during the journey through the
“rain-country”—that borderland between Abyssinia and the Soudan,
which, as I have said, is infested by bandits. We had every reason
to win friends where we could, and every wish to please the young
Habash, so we consented willingly. He told us that the coffee was
already at Delgi, and that he had been informed of the date of our
arrival at that village, at Korata and at Woreb, and had been
looking forward to our coming for a month past. In the evening he
sent us a present of flour and fowls.</p>

<p>After this visit, I walked to the township of Zegi. It is
surrounded by a thick hedge of incense-bush, and this forms the
boundary between the Fituari’s jurisdiction and Hyli’s. Zegi very
closely resembles Korata. It consists of groups of tokhuls
scattered among small, square enclosures where the coffee bushes
grow apparently untended. These plantations, with the cottages and
churches among them, cover the whole promontory. I should estimate
the population, when I saw the place, at about three thousand
souls.</p>

<p>Dr. Stecker’s account of his visit to the town is
brief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> and
interesting, and I quote it. I saw nothing of the stone dwellings
which he describes, and think they must have been replaced by straw
tokhuls since 1881. He wrote:—</p>

<p>“On June 7 I made a <em>tankoa</em>-journey to the peninsula of
Zegi, and climbed to the highest peak, Tekla Haimanot (2074 metres
above sea-level, according to barometrical measurement), which
afforded extremely important survey-bearings.” The traveller then
mentions his visit to Livlivo, Adina, and the island of Dek, and
adds, “The Zegi peninsula is especially famed for its coffee
plantations. Some coffee-trees are as much as a metre in girth. The
coffee is mostly exported to Metemmeh” (Gallabat), “less goes to
Massowah, but it is not considered so good as that of Korata.
Besides coffee the <i>Ensete</i> banana flourishes here
conspicuously, and also the edible species (<i>Musa Ensete
edulis</i>); but, unfortunately, in recent years these charming
plantations have been almost entirely destroyed by a species of pig
called <em>Assama</em> (<i>potamochoerus penicillatus</i>),<a id=
"FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
which is found here in hundreds. This remarkable animal feeds
almost entirely on the roots of these fine bananas. What struck me
here particularly was the neatness of the tokhuls, which are
chiefly of stone, and in general all villages on Lake Tsana have a
much cleanlier and more pleasant appearance than those inland.
There is no lack of clergy on the Zegi Peninsula: there are here no
fewer than seven churches with twelve hundred priests and
defterers.”<a id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class=
"fnanchor">[99]</a> I am bound to say that I saw no indication
during my brief stay that the population was deplorably
priest-ridden!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>I was returning
to camp about four o’clock in the afternoon, and was still at some
distance from it when I met a Habash, who made me understand by
signs that our messenger had brought the Ras’s letter, and as I
hastened on I noticed that the news was already public property.
Upon reaching camp I saw our man, grimy and travel-stained. He and
a companion, with one mule to ride, had covered about a hundred and
thirty miles in four days over very rough country, and they had
waited while the Ras attended to our business; so they had not let
the grass grow under their feet. I felt sorry for the mule. Walda
Mariam had had charge of this business. We had given him one day’s
rest at Bahardar Georgis after his return with Tecla Haimanot’s
message, and then dispatched him on this second journey. It is
expected of these runners, when they are in charge of a missive
from the Negus or a great chief, that they shall not sleep till
they have delivered it. The man bowed low, and handed the Ras’s
letters to me in a manner which showed that he now made me
responsible for their custody. I then learned, by the aid of an
Arab interpreter, that the chief’s reply was of the most favourable
kind, and that he had sent mandates to all concerned to give us
every furtherance on our way round the lake. He also inquired very
courteously about our health and our progress, and had sent a
soldier from his own guard as a special escort for the party. The
Ras, moreover, had even furnished us with letters to chiefs through
whose lands we should not pass on the road to Delgi, to be used in
case we wished to turn aside from the way and visit the
<em>hinterland</em> of the lake district. And, best of all, there
was a communication addressed to Fituari Ali’s son, enjoining upon
him that he should show us every civility. Johannes, who had been
absent from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> camp
when the messenger arrived, had returned by the time my companions
came back from an excursion. The despatches were then interpreted
to them in French, and we enjoyed the prospect of our enemy’s
discomfiture. It was resolved that the mandate to him should be
delivered on the following morning. I noticed that the Habashes did
not appear to make common cause with Ali’s son, but seemed pleased
at our success. Among the Ras’s letters was one to Hyli, which we
sent to him immediately, though it was scarcely required in his
case. Zody was the bearer of it.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span><a id=
"c11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">February</span> the 6th was a
market-day in Zegi. In the morning we mounted our mules and went to
visit St. George’s Church. Hyli was studying in the theological
school attached to this round, thatched place of worship, which
resembled in all respects the others that we had seen in the
country. When the Chief Priest had received a suitable offering,
our Abyssinian friend took us to his house, and here, for
courtesy’s sake, we were obliged to drink <em>tedj</em>—a vile,
bitter draught. We had escaped it on other occasions. The
composition of it has been mentioned elsewhere. Hyli was very
anxious that we should stay and eat a meal with him—doubtless it
would have consisted chiefly of raw meat smothered with red pepper
and sour <em>teff</em> bread—but we managed to excuse ourselves
from this ordeal. On our way back to camp we passed through the
market-place, which was now thronged. I do not know whether any
European had been seen there before; but in any case we were
objects of the utmost curiosity, and the people pressed around us
so thickly that we had a difficulty in making our way through
them.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I returned to the market for the purpose of
obtaining snap-shots. It is held on the top of a stretch of rising
ground, under the shadow of some half a dozen big trees. Under each
tree was a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
stone. On market-days a priest from each of the different churches
stands on the stone allotted to his parish. These men are striking
figures, clad in their ecclesiastical vesture, of which a large
white turban and a shama with a broad red border are the
conspicuous features. The parishioners from the different districts
squat around their pastor near the stone, and the priest takes
tithe in kind upon the spot when any member of his flock completes
a purchase or a sale. Our people bought some grain and two sheep.
The ruling prices were: for an ox (without the hide), seven
shillings; for a sheep, two shillings.</p>

<p>In one of the photographs which I obtained, the curious plaits
in which the married women wear their hair are clearly shown. Stern
thus describes the manner in which the <i>coiffure</i> is preserved
from disarrangement at night. “The woman whose hair has undergone
the tedious process of plaiting, must also have it protected from
becoming dishevelled while she sleeps; and as this cannot so easily
be done in a country where a bullock’s hide or a mat forms the bed,
necessity has contrived a bowl-shaped stool, in which the neck is
wedged. . . . In Abyssinia, where the women are particularly proud
of their copper-coloured charms, very few, even on a journey and
with fifty pounds weight on their backs, will forget to take the
wooden pillow and the hollow grease-filled gourd,” from the
contents of which the hair is “dressed.”<a id=
"FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class=
"fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>I purchased a leopard’s skin in the market for a dollar, but it
was not a good specimen. During the afternoon I received a visit
from another Abyssinian artist, who presented me with two pictures
in return for a black lead-pencil and a part of a blue one. And
I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> had a constant
stream of patients, who claimed attention very freely. I am bound
to say that the maladies from which the majority of them suffered
fully justified the allegation of Dr. Stecker, to which I have
already referred.</p>

<p>The letter from the Ras to the Fituari’s son was delivered early
in the morning. In the evening we heard that no sooner had he
received it than he disappeared, and nobody seemed to know his
whereabouts. No doubt it was his intention to declare afterwards
that he had not been in the village when we arrived. If his conduct
came to the Ras’s knowledge, I have little doubt the vainglorious
youth was flogged—this has been the penalty inflicted on other
Habashes who have shown rudeness to travellers provided with the
King’s safe-conduct letter.</p>

<p>Our tents at Zegi were in a pleasant position, under a spreading
fig tree; these trees are found throughout Abyssinia and in the
“rain country,” and give abundant shade. I have never seen them
growing thickly, in a clump.</p>

<p>We made an early start on the morning of February the 7th, and
trotted ahead at a good speed, as the donkeys were very fresh after
their rest. The country is similar to that which we traversed in
approaching Zegi. At eleven o’clock we reached the bank of the
Abai. At the ford where we were to cross, it is a broad river, more
than a hundred yards in width, as I should judge. The water was
running in a fairly rapid current, and I was told that the stream
is perennial. The banks of the river are steep, and the bed is
stony. The water, at that season of the year, was almost clear. But
during the rains, when the stream is in flood, it brings down vast
quantities of the deposits of the white ants and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span> other detritus. The flat
island of Dek has been formed by siltage of alluvial soil thus
brought, and it is matter in solution which renders the course of
the Abai traceable in Lake Tsana.</p>

<p>At the ford we found that the water came just above a man’s
knee. The crossing gave us little trouble, and there was no serious
mishap. The larger loads and our valises—of the “Wolseley”
pattern—were wetted, but the sun soon dried them. One donkey
collapsed, and fell with his burden into the stream about two yards
from the further bank; but there were many to help, and he was soon
put on his feet again. He was not carrying anything which would be
ruined by a soaking. The rise beyond the ford was steep, and the
drippings from the wet animals made it slippery, so we had to throw
earth on it to give them a foothold, as in crossing the Gelda.</p>

<p>After passing the Abai, we entered a flat district full of the
long dry grass, of which we had seen so much on the north side of
the lake. The country hereabouts is full of the kind of gazelle
called <em>oribi</em>. We had not elsewhere in Abyssinia found
these creatures in herds. Game birds abound in this region, which
appeared to be almost deserted. We passed scarcely any villages,
and those which we saw consisted of only five or six huts.</p>

<p>Our camping-ground was an open space not far from a papyrus
swamp. We should not have selected this spot by choice, as the
proximity of marshy soil was a danger to health. But we were
obliged to halt there because no water was to be had for a
considerable distance on the road ahead. All around were ruins of
houses built of stone, with thatched roofs that had fallen in. The
number of them showed that a town or a large<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_166">[166]</span> village must have existed here at one
time. Stone dwellings are not usual in this region, and I inquired
what the name of the place was and tried to learn its history, but
could get no information.</p>

<p>Dupuis and Crawley went out with their rifles, and added three
oribis to the store in the larder. I stayed in camp “on duty,” and
after treating a patient sat reading outside my tent. My servant
rushed up to me, and said that I was wanted to shoot a snake that
had crept under some brushwood. I hastened to unpack my gun and ran
after the boy, and soon came to where our men, in a state of great
excitement, had formed a cordon round a patch of dry grass, to
which they had set fire. Finally the snake came out, and all our
fellows shouted at it. They were in mortal terror of it, as a fact,
and certainly it looked “an ugly customer.” It was too big to be
stopped by shot unless I could make sure of hitting it in the head,
and this I was not able to manage before it crawled under a saddle
belonging to one of the soldiers. The saddle was lifted by the aid
of a long pole, and in a moment the snake’s head was smashed by the
same means. I measured it, and found that it was just over two
yards in length. The back was brown and the belly white, and the
skull had the typical shape of the adder family. Generally
speaking, we saw fewer reptiles in Abyssinia than we had
expected.</p>

<p>After this incident, I strolled round the camp with my gun, and
presently noticed a little grey animal scampering among the stones
of a ruined house. It was of the same colour exactly as the stones,
but presently I believed I could discern an eye, and, being anxious
to ascertain what creature it was, took aim and fired. I walked up
to the spot but found nothing, looked around and wondered how the
animal could have vanished.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_167">[167]</span> At the moment I heard the rustling of a
leaf beyond the tumbledown wall on the left, and, guided by the
sound, discovered the animal just dead. It was a specimen of the
hyrax—an interesting creature to biologists, which Huxley described
as “the type of a distinct order, in many respects intermediate
between the <i>Ungulata</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Rodentia</i>
and <i>Insectivora</i> on the other.”<a id=
"FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class=
"fnanchor">[101]</a> It is found only in Syria and Africa. I
thought the skin worth preserving, and one of the soldiers flayed
it for me.</p>

<p>On Sunday, February 8, our road lay, for the most part, at some
little distance from the lake, which was out of sight till the end
of the journey. We plodded on through long grass and past burnt
patches. The track is only about a foot wide, and in consequence
the loads of the donkeys extended beyond it on either side. When
they were among the tall growth they had to sweep it aside from
their burden as they went, and this tired them greatly.</p>

<p>We reached the edge of the lake at two o’clock, after an
unbroken journey of six and a half hours, and pitched our camp.
About two hundred yards from the shore five hippos were standing,
well clear of the water. They looked for all the world like rocks,
even when we brought field-glasses to bear on them. After lunch
Crawley had the Berthon boat put together, and I rowed him towards
the hippos. When we were within a hundred yards of them, I
considered that the range was quite short enough to give the
marksman an opportunity of displaying his skill, and he got no
nearer. He began practice at once, but the boat was pitching rather
sharply, and this made aiming with the rifle almost<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> chance-work. Presently the
sport became like firing at disappearing targets, for the hippos
rose only once in two or three minutes to breathe. If they had
taken my friend seriously, we should probably not have left Lake
Tsana, and I felt relieved when he had had enough of the pastime
and we rowed ashore.</p>

<p>Various small offerings of milk and bread reached us from the
hamlets around. The milk is always sour. The Habashes do not drink
it when it is fresh, and as a consequence they never wash the
gourds in which they keep it, because it “turns” sooner in a dirty
receptacle. At a few places we were able to have the cows brought
into camp, and stored the milk in our own vessels, but this was
impossible when we only remained one night on a camping-ground.</p>

<p>That evening Johannes, the interpreter, had a touch of fever. On
the previous night his tent had been close to the papyrus swamp,
and this, no doubt, accounted for the attack.</p>

<p>On the following day, February 9, our road lay through more
broken country and more pleasing scenery. The track led us up
hills, and down them, and between them, and sometimes close beside
the lake. I saw no trees in this region but mimosas; the ground was
covered in places by mimosa scrub, in others by dry grass. We made
a march of seventeen miles, as we reckoned, a longer distance than
we had travelled on the previous day. The donkeys were tired out at
the end of the journey. Some stood still and refused to move,
others lay down under their burdens in the path. We camped on the
shore of the lake, at a spot very similar to that which we had
chosen for our last halting-place.</p>

<p>The interpreter’s fever had yielded considerably to<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> the usual quinine treatment,
and he seemed very little the worse for his long ride in the
heat.</p>

<p>In the evening the wind rose and presently blew hard enough to
make me wonder whether my tent would collapse or not. I observed
that very soon enough wash was knocked up in the deeper water to
stop the headway of a rowing-boat. The lake would be a perfect
place for fishing and sailing in the dry season. But without
experience and watchfulness, risks would arise—quite apart from the
humours of the hippopotami.<a id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday, February 10, after a journey of about twelve miles
through tall grass that impeded our baggage-train, we reached the
village of Delgi, and pitched our camp upon the same ground which
we had chosen for our first halting-place beside the lake. To the
best of my belief, we were the only Europeans who had ever
completed the circuit of this lovely reservoir of the Nile—the
distance in all is one hundred and sixty to one hundred and seventy
miles. Those who love regions beyond the outposts of our
civilization, where the tourist ceases from troubling, could not
seek isolation amid sweeter surroundings than this sunlit lake,
these tropical mountains, and the quaint, quiet hamlets of a
primitive people, who as yet, thank Heaven, have not been infected
with “Yankee hustle.”</p>

<p>The level of the surface of the water had sunk perceptibly since
we were here a month ago, and many rocks were now visible which had
then been covered. But I do not think the variation between the
maximum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> height in
the rainy season and the minimum in the dry is very great; I doubt
if it exceeds eight or ten feet.</p>

<p>At midday we noticed that the climate into which we had come in
the north-west corner of the lake was distinctly warmer than that
of the other parts. We remembered the Soudan, towards which our
faces were set, and knew that in the heat there we should think
longingly of the waterside, in spite of all the worries inseparable
from travelling in Abyssinia.</p>

<p>The “Sultan” of Delgi came to camp to welcome us as soon as he
heard of our arrival. It was pleasant to meet this cheery, genial
old Habash again, and his visit put us in good spirits. He brought
us a couple of chickens and some bread, and we showed our
hospitality by offering him chartreuse. He drank half a pint at a
draught without “turning a hair,” seemed none the worse for it, and
wanted more. A man who remains sober after that performance must
have a sound head and a strong body, but I do not recommend even
the hardiest of my readers to attempt the feat. The Abyssinians who
survive have inured their stomachs to excesses of abstinence from
food as well as gluttonous excesses, an unwholesome and repulsive
diet and the abuse of condiments, and they have constitutions <i>à
toute épreuve</i>. I may mention that the children, who would be
the first to suffer from bad climatic conditions, and the women
seemed, as a body, fairly healthy, though they eat raw flesh like
the men and suffer from the consequent parasitical trouble.</p>

<p>Nothing was mentioned or seen of the “Deputy” who had tried to
prevent us from reaching the lake. But we made kindly inquiry for
the “Sultan’s” wife, who had shown us goodwill and sent us bread
and <em>tedj</em> on our first arrival, and were glad to hear that
the lady was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> in
good health. At nightfall we saw that the grass was blazing in two
places, and it was interesting to observe with what extraordinary
swiftness the flames ran over the ground when the breeze from the
lake fanned them.</p>

<p>We had determined to show our liking for the “Sultan” by
treating him handsomely when we gave the customary presents. He
came into camp next day (February 11) as soon as we had finished
breakfast, and we arranged the gifts on the table. They were a
revolver, a folding-chair, a bottle of chartreuse, and a red silk
cummerbund for his consort. He appeared to be well pleased and
thanked us, through Johannes, with all the formalities of the
country. We suggested that he should come for a row in the Berthon
boat, but he backed out of this immediately. Then he had his new
folding-chair carried to the shore, and sat there surrounded by his
bodyguard, a force which would have had a great success in a
pantomime. He followed our movements with much interest while we
put the boat together, but he was plainly apprehensive when Crawley
tested in still water the electric current-meter which he had used
in calculating the outflow from the lake into the Blue Nile. It
made a buzzing noise, and I think he suspected that it might “go
off” at any moment. He remarked that it was <em>a watch</em> for
the water, but he soon retired, followed by his comedians under
arms.</p>

<p>Everything in camp that could be cleaned in water was washed in
the lake during the day, and the ground near our tents looked like
an improvised laundry. It was strewn in all directions with
articles spread out to dry. Those boys who had no change of
garments, stayed in the water while their clothes were aired in the
sunshine, and enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Both Christians and Mussulmans received an ox on<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> this day in order that they
might make biltong for the journey. We bought flour and grain and
sheep and fowls, and laid in as large a stock of provisions as we
could carry for use in the uninhabited borderland between Delgi and
Gallabat.</p>

<p>February 12 was our last day beside Lake Tsana, and the prospect
of leaving it filled me with regret. The “Sultan” came into camp
again, and in answer to one or two questions gave us the following
information: that the rainfall on the margin of the lake in the wet
season is not great; the heavy rains descend upon the heights
around, and the floods are carried down the rivers and khors in
overwhelming torrents, so that all the watercourses are then
impassable. This circumstance, of course, has a very important
bearing on the possibility of a commercial development of the
region.</p>

<p>Before quitting the subject, I will bring to the reader’s notice
Dr. Stecker’s thoughtful conclusions as to the present relation of
the River Abai to Lake Tsana:—</p>

<p>“I made another extremely interesting discovery in the Gorgora
mountains, viz. of a remarkable shell, which by its character
reminds one of the oyster.<a id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> We found both the shells
and the living creatures in abundance on the shore. With lemon
juice they taste like genuine oysters. But it is remarkable that I
had already found this species in the Blue Nile, and that I found
it later on the island of Dek, enclosed in unmistakable volcanic
rock (tuff). I can only offer this explanation, that, at a time
when Lake Tsana already existed, a great eruption took place in the
south. According to my view the lake<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_173">[173]</span> had its origin in tertiary times as a
consequence of a great volcanic movement in the north (at the
Gorgora range). The Abai, which was previously an unimportant
stream, and described the great curve which is indicated on my map
by arrows, and now carries it round Dek and Dega, was forced in
consequence to the south-western and southern shores, though its
original course can still be traced quite distinctly. The second
volcanic movement took place, according to my opinion, in the
south, and the islands of Dek<a id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and Dega in Lake Tsana
owe their origin to it, as do a whole series of islands beside the
eastern shore of the lake and the masses of rock of volcanic origin
which encumber the course of the Blue Nile and lie scattered in the
whole valley of that river.”<a id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The moon was full that night, and the lake and the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> mountains formed a glorious
scene, which left in the mind a longing to behold it again. Lake
Tsana has that haunting, attractive power which some places
possess, and which prompts one to return to them in spite of all
that commonsense says about obstacles and discomfort.</p>

<p>On February 13 we made an early start upon our return journey to
the Soudan, and reached the top of the plateau at half-past ten. We
saw nothing, after all, of Hyli’s men; I did not hear why they
failed to join us. As we now retraced our steps over the same
ground that we had traversed on the way to the lake, I shall not
give any detailed account of our progress. In one day’s journey we
covered a distance which had given us an arduous two days’ climb on
the upward march, and we came again into the region of the
Soudanese heat. The sequence of vegetation according to altitude
was strikingly apparent during the descent. Throughout the first
half of it we were in the cactus country, then in the bamboo zone,
and, finally, among the mimosas and desert scrub. The heat proved
trying to man and beast. We Europeans felt fagged and dull; I had
three fever patients among our followers in the evening; and the
donkeys straggled into camp jaded and spent.</p>

<p>An incident of the journey will show the nature of the road. A
little while after we had passed the long and narrow gorge which
has already been described, I caught sight of my valise and some
other luggage stacked on a bank. Upon asking why it was there, I
found that the donkey which had carried the load had slipped from
the path and had fallen and rolled about ninety or a hundred feet.
The beast seemed none the worse for the adventure, and the boys
were bringing up the baggage piecemeal from the ledge which had
stopped the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> donkey.
I have no doubt that its burden saved it; a rider might have
performed the same service if his remains had kept in place. A
mirror and a candle-globe which “accomplished the descent” were not
injured.</p>

<p>In spite of the steepness and roughness of the path—the
mountains are genuine <em>sierras</em> (saws)—I believe that no
great trouble and expense would be needed to make this approach to
Western Abyssinia easy and safe, but it would be impossible for
camels.</p>

<p>On the following day we reached the banks of the River Gerar, on
which there is a thick growth of bamboos. Many of these had fallen
across the track. We were not so much impeded by them as we should
have been but for our previous experience of this part of the road.
We sent men ahead with axes to clear the path as well as they
could. In the evening we lost one of our baggage animals for the
first time; two donkeys fell on the road exhausted. We left them
while we moved on into camp, in the hope that they would recover.
One was brought in later, but the other was found to be in such a
helpless and pitiable state that nothing remained but to put it out
of its misery, and it was shot. Our camp was beside the hot springs
which have already been mentioned. We found in the neighbouring
huts apparently the same company that we had seen on the upward
journey. I was not able to learn anything about the people.</p>

<p>On the following day we left the valley of the Gerar, crossed a
high ridge, and then followed the course of the Shemal Warhar. When
we reached the place where we had pitched our camp before, we found
the trees charred and the ground blackened by fire. There was no
shade, and the water in the pools was very low. So we marched about
three miles to another camping-ground called Ananta. Here water and
shade were plentiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>On February 16
we reached the bank of the Gundar Warhar. From midday till three
o’clock the thermometer showed a temperature of 98° F. We had now
entered the region in which robber bands are active. On the 17th we
passed two parties of traders and heard from them our first news of
the world outside Abyssinia. This was that Slatin Pasha had arrived
at Gallabat on a tour of inspection. We thought of Gallabat—by
contrast—as a centre of civilization. Our halting-place was a
pleasant, shady spot beside the river-bed, in which water was
abundant. In the afternoon Crawley shot a water-buck. I secured a
much smaller prize in the form of another civet-cat. We heard that
a large crocodile had been seen in a pool about two hundred yards
from camp, but saw nothing of the beast. At night we were much
plagued by mosquitoes and the beetles which swarm on one and do not
bite, but are malodorous in death—a most perplexing pest.</p>

<p>On the 18th the temperature rose to 101° F. in the shade. We
made a short march, but one of our donkeys succumbed and had to be
left for the vultures. We found that the grass about our former
camping-ground had been trodden down and a part of it burned. The
water, too, was much lower in the pools, the dry season being now
far advanced, though it was still abundant to meet all the
requirements likely to arise in that country before the rains. At
this time of the year the trees cast their leaves, so that there is
much less shade along the track. On the 19th we reached the
“warsha,” which is the first from Gallabat on the road to Abyssinia
and the last on the return journey. The ground was in a filthy
state, and it was evident that many people had encamped at the
place since we left it. Water was plentiful; it was drawn from a
deep pool. To our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
horror, just as we had settled to rest in our chairs, we saw some
of our boys and camp-followers washing their persons and their
clothes in the water which we were to drink! One of them was a
leprous trader. We raised some first-class trouble about this, and
posted a sentry by the pool. But all we could do was to boil and
filter the water thoroughly—and think of the other people who had
bathed in it since we last tasted it. On Friday, February 20, we
arrived at Gallabat.</p>

<p>I will not dilate on the traveller’s delight in seeing again a
batch of envelopes addressed to him in familiar handwriting. It is
one of the pleasures which is becoming rare, but a trip into
Western Abyssinia still provides an opportunity for it. In the town
I met the Doctor of Kassala. He was then making a tour of
inspection with the object of discovering cases of leprosy. The
Egyptian Government has wisely ordained that lepers shall be
compulsorily segregated; there is a hospital for them at Gallabat,
which serves as a receiving station. An attempt is being made to
form a colony of these stricken people, where they may cultivate
the land and live by their labour.</p>

<p>The water which we had drunk at “Warsha No. 1” punished us
rather severely for our rashness. And while suffering from this
inward infirmity, I saw the camels that were waiting to wreak their
eccentricities upon us during the remainder of the journey. It was
our intention to follow the upper course of the river Atbara
through Sofi to Kassala. This was formerly a frequented route, but
the Dervishes had destroyed all the villages that stood beside it,
and, as a consequence, the disused track had become impassable. It
was then being repaired, but the work was still some way short of
completion, and it seemed that we might be compelled,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> after all, to return as we had
come by the road through Gedaref. However, our chief telegraphed to
Mr. Flemming, asking him to send a gang of men, if possible, to the
spot where the track was in the worst condition, and this he did.
So we were able to carry out our plan, and had the satisfaction of
being the first travellers who journeyed by the repaired highway
from Gallabat to Kassala.</p>

<p>On February 22 we paid off the escort and followers who had gone
into Abyssinia with us. Johannes received as presents a revolver
and a watch, the others a gift of money. We found that nearly all
preferred a settlement by means of drafts on Colonel Harrington at
Addis Abbiba. If they carried cash through the “rain country” they
would run a great risk of losing both their money and their lives.
Before we bade farewell to Johannes, he told us that we had on one
occasion, unconsciously, been in no small danger in Abyssinia. At a
certain village a rumour was spread that King Menelek had sold the
lake to the British. The supposed transfer was by no means to the
taste of the Habashes—and we represented the English interest.
Disregarding the niceties of French grammar, Johannes remarked that
he had <i>beaucoup de peur</i> at the time. In our case ignorance
was bliss.</p>

<p>On this day we said good-bye to Zodi. He had decided to return
to his own country with Johannes. We all wished that he could have
finished the journey with us, but felt that we should not be
justified in discharging him finally in a country where he was
ignorant of the language. He took his leave of us, bowing to the
ground and addressing us in his own tongue. His face bore an
expression which it is difficult to describe; he was showing his
spotlessly white teeth in a smile, but<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_179">[179]</span> he was half crying nevertheless. I have
always wished that I could have engaged him as my servant. He was
an excellent and faithful lad, and I believe that he did us
valuable service when we were near Zegi, and the Fituari’s son was
inclined to give trouble. Zody, as a native of the lakeside
(Korata), was able to influence his neighbours on the opposite
shore when a Habash from another district might have been
disregarded or set at naught.</p>

<p>My two companions went out with their rifles in the afternoon,
and there was no slight commotion in Gallabat when they were heard
firing at antelopes in the distance. During our absence, as I have
already mentioned, an Abyssinian band had raided two villages and
carried off thirty-eight men and boys into slavery. The noise of
the discharges made the natives think that the slave-raiders were
at their work again. The very serious political consequences which
these incursions will certainly cause sooner or later have been
alluded to before.</p>

<p>It may interest my readers, if, before saying the last word
about Gallabat, I give a brief account of the battle which took
place there in March, 1889, between King John of Abyssinia and the
Dervishes. Perhaps no incident in modern history so strangely
combines the oriental and the mediæval atmospheres, or so oddly
illustrates the effect of weapons of precision in warfare of the
biblical type. A detailed narrative has been given by Mr. Augustus
Wylde.<a id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class=
"fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The Dervishes had invaded Abyssinia in 1887, at a time when the
forces of the Negus were scattered. They defeated Tecla Haimanot
and devastated the region to the north of Lake Tsana. In 1888 they
renewed the invasion, but in the meanwhile the King of Godjam’s
army had been reinforced and his troops had been<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> rearmed. The Dervishes
suffered a severe defeat. The Negus completed his preparations in
the winter of 1888-9, and gave notice to the Khalifa of his
intention to march upon Omdurman. The Dervishes massed about
seventy thousand men at Gallabat, where they occupied a large
zareba which was protected by a dyke and some redoubts. They also
had artillery in the fort where the scorpions have now become so
formidable. But they were badly supplied with small-arms, whereas
King John’s men had a plentiful stock of effective rifles of a
French pattern.</p>

<p>The Dervish position was surrounded by the Abyssinian army. The
Khalifa’s men were crowded in their enclosure, and, owing to its
construction, could not fire from it without exposing themselves.
The Abyssinian marksmen did terrible execution, and finally a body
of King John’s horse, supported by a hot rifle-fire at short range,
burned the thorns of the zareba at several points and filled up the
ditch. The position was then “rushed,” and only a few of the
Dervishes, aided by the smoke and the confusion, escaped.</p>

<p>“Facing King Johannes’s bodyguard,” says Mr. Wylde, “one small
redoubt, strongly fortified and held by the black slave soldiers of
the Dervishes, still held out, and their rifle-fire was doing some
execution. The King, getting angry that it had not been taken in
the rear by the troops that had entered the sides of the
fortifications, and who were engaged in plundering, went forward to
attack it with his followers. The gaudy dresses worn by his staff,
with their silver shields and the bright silks, drew the fire of
the defenders. King Johannes was struck by a bullet that traversed
the lower part of his arm and entered the intestines near the
navel, taking into the wound a part of his dress. He still
gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span> orders, and
kept on the field till the redoubt was rushed and those in it all
killed.”</p>

<p>The King died about twenty-four hours after he was wounded.
Quarrels with regard to the succession immediately commenced among
the Rases, and instead of following up their victory, they retired
at once into Abyssinia with their captives and plunder, in order to
serve the interests of their respective factions.</p>

<p>“On the 11th, in the afternoon, old Ras Areya, the King’s uncle,
a man nearly eighty years of age, who had played a wonderful part
in Abyssinian history, was left with a few followers to bring back
the King’s body for burial. The body had been cut in half so that
it could be carried more easily, and was put in a clothes-box so
that it could be laden on a mule. Only a few of the King’s devoted
servants remained behind, with a few priests and their armed
servants. On the 12th, while following the Taccazze road, the sad
and mournful procession was overtaken by a few Dervishes and some
Arabs, who had returned on the night of the 10th to reconnoitre
Gallabat, and when they found it abandoned they had followed one of
the lines of retreat to find out what was going on and the reason
the Abyssinian victory had not been followed up.”<a id=
"FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class=
"fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Ras Areya could have escaped, but died, with a few of his
soldiers and the bravest of the King’s servants, defending all that
remained of his liege. He “was last seen standing alongside the box
containing the King’s body, after having expended all his
ammunition, with his shield and sword in his hands.” He was speared
by a Dervish from behind. The Khalifa made no attempt to invade
Abyssinia in force after the battle of Gallabat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>Mr. Wylde
received this information from a priest who was present and who
escaped, though he was badly wounded. I was told that the King died
in a small hut, attended by two monks and four nuns, who tried to
keep his death secret, and that an old woman, a servant of the
nuns, being captured later by the Dervishes, revealed, in order to
save her life, the line of retreat of the party that was bearing
away the King’s body.</p>

<p>The encounter took place at night, and such a scene in the
moonlight seems more like an imagined passage in an epic than an
occurrence in the closing years of the last century. I do not know
whether the nuns accompanied Ras Areya, nor what their fate was.
The Dervishes cut off the King’s head and carried it to the Khalifa
at Omdurman.</p>

<p>There are numerous graves around Gallabat of those who fell in
the engagement. These are mounds, on which are laid agates brought
from the bed of the Atbara. The tombs of the Soudanese have upon
them a calabash, or more usually a pair, containing grain and
water—presumably to satisfy the needs of the dead man’s shade. I do
not know how the custom of solacing the deceased thus is reconciled
with the doctrine of Islam.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span><a id=
"c12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> valley of the River
Atbara can now scarcely be regarded as unfamiliar country. Those
who wish to read a most lively, interesting account of all the
opportunities that it offers to the sportsman, should turn to Sir
Samuel Baker’s book, “The Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia.” Our
journey from Gallabat to Cairo by way of Kassala can be quite
briefly described.</p>

<p>In reply to our inquiry we received a telegram from Mr.
Flemming, who told us that a guide would meet our party at an
appointed spot to show us the now disused and obscured road, and on
the morning of February 23 we left Gallabat. About four hours’
travelling over flat, rocky country brought us, by an easy descent,
to the Atbara. The banks here are low, and the bed is hard and
clean, with tracts of shingle in it. The breadth of the course is
about a hundred and fifty yards, and there were large pools of
clear, good water. Many of them were deep. At this season of the
year an insignificant stream trickles from pool to pool, and
sometimes disappears altogether. There are big fish in these pools,
and they need cautious handling. I took my tackle after we had
pitched our camp, landed a two-pounder, and was “wool-gathering” a
few moments afterwards when a powerful fish seized my bait with a
dash and had me off my balance in an instant; result, a bruised
knee and two hooks lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>Next day Dupuis
moved ahead of the party with his Soudanese “Shikari,” and in a
couple of hours stalked and shot a gazelle and a bushbuck with a
fine pair of horns; later in the day a haartebeest fell to his
rifle. We saw great numbers of gazelles and ariels, and the country
was full of game. The tracks left by many kinds of animals going to
and from the river were visible in all directions. In addition,
guinea-fowl were plentiful. The ground near the river was covered
with dry grass, and there was a thin but continuous growth of
mimosa scrub. The baobab tree flourishes in this region.<a id=
"FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class=
"fnanchor">[108]</a> We camped on the site of a village that had
been laid waste by the Dervishes. No vestige of it remained but
potsherds.</p>

<p>When the flesh of the animals was being cut into strips for use
as biltong, a host of the carrion birds of all orders gathered
around us—crows, hawks, vultures, and marabous. There was something
disquieting and unpleasant in the presence of these groups of
eagerly expectant scavengers, which faced us wherever we turned,
and eyed us from every tree. That night the mosquitoes “rushed” my
curtains and made a most successful raid, retreating at sunrise
from the stricken—and bitten—field.</p>

<p>Shortly after we had started on February 25, I saw, at a little
distance from camp, a piece of neatly made basketwork, and picked
it up. Further on I found another. On<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_185">[185]</span> making inquiry I was told that these were
parts of game-traps. A log is buried in the ground, and a piece of
cord with a noose at the loose end is attached to it. Then a hole
is dug where tracks of game are seen, the noose is “set” in the
hole, the basketwork is laid down to cover the trap, and the cord
is hidden by a layer of earth. When a beast steps into the hole,
the movement of the basketwork pulls the noose tight around its
leg. The more the beast struggles, the firmer the grip becomes;
finally, as a rule, the log is pulled up by its exertions, and the
hobbled creature limps away, but is easily caught, and can then be
killed as the Mohammedan rite requires.</p>

<p>The track in this region is kept open by the cutting down of
mimosa scrub. It lies upon “cotton soil” with fissures in it, large
and small. The camels, which stare stupidly ahead while they walk,
are constantly stumbling on account of these holes; their legs seem
to have a marvellous instinct for finding them. Another difficulty
was the descent and ascent in numerous little khors which run down
to the river bed, and the camel is singularly clumsy when it leaves
level ground. We pitched our camp at midday on the site of another
deserted village, called Wad Abou Simam. Before that time each of
my friends had shot a waterbuck. Very sensibly, the Anglo-Egyptian
Administration imposes a fine on those who shoot the females of the
larger antelopes.</p>

<p>I think we must have seen hundreds of thousands of guinea-fowl
during the last two days’ journey. They were in the jungle of
mimosa scrub and neblik and on the shingle in the river bed, where
by reason of their colour they can scarcely be distinguished from
the stones; in fact, they swarmed in all directions. I
took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> my gun into
the dry course of the Atbara and sat down near an islet which was
covered with very dry grass. This was a favourite place of refuge
for the guinea-fowl. Dupuis drove them to the bank, where they
rose, and flocks of them flew towards the little island. In this
way I had some fine practice, and the birds were always useful in
the larder. Travellers in this region should set up their
mosquito-curtains with care. I was remiss about it that night, and
the determined and virulent insects bit my scalp, face, and hands
through the covering. The next evening I was more attentive to the
matter, and formed a frame by means of four dhurra stalks. This
arrangement, with draping, had all the advantages and some of the
solid dignity of a four-post bedstead.</p>

<p>On the following day (February 26) we encamped at Sherafa. There
was no incident worthy of mention during the journey. In the
afternoon Dupuis and I saw a crocodile within range in the river
bed, and fired at the same moment. The only visible result was that
he scuttled into a pool and disappeared.</p>

<p>On the 27th Crawley brought down an ariel, but we had entered a
district in which game was much rarer. We reached a well at a place
called Tubra Cullah. This has been dug at the edge of a rock, the
water was brackish, and there was no trough for the camels. We had
now left the course of the Atbara, but had, fortunately, brought
with us water from the pools which was sufficient for the men. On
this day the temperature rose to 107° F. in the shade. The road,
which had at that time been cleared, ended at Tubra Cullah, and
here we were met by the guide whom Mr. Flemming had sent to show us
the unrepaired track between this place and Sofi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>On the following
day we marched to Goratia. Our guide had misinformed us as to the
distance, which was much greater than we had expected. The heat was
scarcely endurable, and none of our marches had been more
fatiguing. How we longed for the coolness and freshness of the
lakeside! Close to the village was a well with good water and
troughs for the camels, which had not drunk for nearly forty-eight
hours. We found the inhabitants very willing to help our men. While
we were passing through Goratia the women within the huts warbled
their welcome in the usual manner and with unmistakable enthusiasm.
We learned that when our party was first sighted, a rumour spread
that we were Abyssinian raiders, and the non-combatants rushed to
the shelter of their homes. The relief of the villagers was
evidently very great when they found that we were English
people.</p>

<p>The following instance may serve to show the difficulty which
British administrators have in suppressing the slave traffic.</p>

<p>A certain man, a native of the White Nile region, appeared one
morning before Colonel G. at Rosaires and said that while he was
taking a convoy of slaves into Abyssinia, he had been stopped by
the sheikh of a village in the Colonel’s district. This sheikh, he
asserted, took possession of the slaves, and bound him and his
companion, to whom they belonged. In order to keep what he had
captured and destroy those who could bring him to justice, the
sheikh had the two slave-dealers brought to a precipice and cast
over it. Ono was killed, the other escaped with whole limbs. Then
he repaired to the Governor’s quarters to report the matter.</p>

<p>Colonel G. ordered the sheikh to attend and bring the slaves
that he had taken. The sheikh, astounded<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_188">[188]</span> to hear that the Moudir<a id=
"FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class=
"fnanchor">[109]</a> had learned what he had done, attributed his
misfortune to the Will of God with the usual phrase
“Inshallah,”<a id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class=
"fnanchor">[110]</a> and started for the Moudirieh accompanied by
the slaves. On the way he consoled himself with the words, “God
will help me” (<em>Rabonna effrighi</em>).</p>

<p>While he was upon the journey he met two native merchants
returning to their village, and immediately he concluded that Allah
had heard his prayer. “Um del Allah!” said he, “God is good.” He
caused the merchants to be bound, and then he had the slaves
brought before him, and made them all swear upon the Koran that
these two men were they who had raided the village and carried the
people away captive. And the merchants were forced to follow him
with the slaves.</p>

<p>When the sheikh arrived at the Moudirieh, the Governor ordered
him to deliver up the men in whose possession he had found the
slaves—and the sheikh forthwith had the two merchants led forward.
Colonel G. was in a dilemma. Evidently the raider who had
complained to him was telling the truth, but all the slaves swore
that they knew nothing of the man. Questioning was of no avail, and
did not shake their evidence. Then the Moudir, turning suddenly to
a little girl, asked her, “Who told you to say that these two
accused men raided your village and took you away?” The little girl
instantly pointed to the sheikh and answered, “Please, sir, that
man.”</p>

<p>This decided the matter. Some time after, the body of the
slave-dealer’s companion was found. I did not hear what befell the
sheikh, but the Moudir was not a man to be trifled with, and I have
no doubt that justice was done.</p>

<p>The sheikh of Goratia came into camp to greet us,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> and afterwards sent us hot
coffee, which was excellent. It is the most refreshing drink of all
after a tiring journey in the baking sunshine.</p>

<p>In this village we found a man who declared that he could act as
guide to the junction of the Atbara and the River Salaam, a point
which is of interest in connection with the all-important problem
of water-storage and distribution. It has not been sketched or
mapped—indeed, I believe that no European has yet succeeded in
reaching it, though the British officers in the Soudan have been
eager to discover the spot. My two companions arranged to start on
the following morning and endeavour to make a rough survey of the
place.</p>

<p>At Goratia I obtained a photograph which shows clearly the
amulet worn by almost all the Soudanese. The youth who wore it had
been married about a week, and the scars on his back illustrate a
singular custom among the people. Sir Samuel Baker has described
it.</p>

<p>“There is but little lovemaking among the Arabs. The affair of
matrimony usually commences by a present to the father of the girl,
which, if accepted, is followed by a similar advance to the girl
herself, and the arrangement is completed. All the friends of both
parties are called together for the wedding; pistols and guns are
fired off, if possessed. There is much feasting, and the
unfortunate bridegroom undergoes the ordeal of whipping by the
relations of his bride, in order to test his courage. Sometimes
this punishment is exceedingly severe, being inflicted with the
coorbash or whip of hippopotamus hide, which is cracked vigorously
about his ribs and back. If the happy husband wishes to be
considered a man worth having, he must receive the chastisement
with an expression of enjoyment; in which case the crowds of women
in admiration again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
raise their thrilling cry. After the rejoicings of the day are
over, the bride is led in the evening to the residence of her
husband, while a beating of drums and strumming of guitars
(rhababas) are kept up for some hours during the night, with the
usual discordant idea of singing.”<a id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to compare Mansfield Parkyns’s description of
the mode of duelling in Dongola.</p>

<p>“This duel is not a serious matter, but is engaged in by young
men on the slightest possible pretext, often merely to display
their manhood. An angareeb, under which a jar of beer is usually
set (for refreshment between the rounds), is placed between the
combatants, each of whom is stripped to the waist, and armed with
one of the formidable whips I have described” (coorbash). “As soon
as all is ready they begin, giving alternate stripes on each
other’s shoulders, but neither being allowed to evade or ward off a
blow; they continue this agreeable pastime for a very long time,
till one falls down exhausted from loss of blood and the punishment
he has received.”<a id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112"
class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>I spent a lazy day on March 1, watching the peaceful,
patriarchal life of the village, and especially the flocks and
herds when they came to the well to drink. Men, women, and boys all
helped to fill the cattle-troughs, which are made of baked mud. The
surroundings described in the book of Genesis seemed to have been
preserved here without change of any kind.</p>

<p>My friends did not return on March 2, as they had expected. I
took my rifle and a guide and tried to bring home an ariel, but
could not approach within three hundred yards of the game. At about
that distance one was hit, but got away. On the 3rd the guide and I
went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span> in another
direction. Creeping carefully up against the wind, I aimed at a
buck at three hundred yards’ distance. He fell forward, burying his
horns in the ground, when I fired, but was up again, and ran in a
circle and then fell once more. I rushed forward to give him the
<i>coup-de-grace</i>, but he bolted over the brow of a hill at the
top of his speed, and we lost sight of him. I wandered about
seeking for his tracks, but could not find them in that tumbled
country. Later I saw three more ariels, which ran into some dry
grass. We made a circuit, and presently came within sight of them
again. They were evidently on the alert. Under cover of a tree, I
took a steady aim and hit a buck, who limped away and lay down, but
presently rose at eighty yards distance as we advanced, and I then
killed him by a shot through the heart. We covered the body with
branches to protect it from vultures, and carried the head into
camp. I kept the skin and the head, but gave the flesh to my guide,
who was much delighted. He went out on a donkey and cut the beast
up, and distributed presents of meat among his friends.</p>

<p>My companions returned half an hour after midday. They had had
difficulty in finding the course of the Atbara, and their camels
had been on the march eight hours when they reached it at a gorge
in coarse sandstone rock, where the river forces its way through a
narrow cleft about twenty metres wide, between cliffs rising
vertically from a profoundly deep pool. There they determined to
encamp and spend the next day in attempting to find the junction of
the rivers. To the great disappointment of all, they failed to
achieve their purpose. The country in which they were is extremely
wild. A lion had killed one of their camels in broad daylight. The
boy who was in charge of the beasts<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_192">[192]</span> while they browsed saw the lion creep from
the thick undergrowth, spring upon the camel and crush its skull
with one blow of the paw. He screamed, and the lion walked off into
the scrub in which it had been concealed. The other camels were
terrified, and would certainly have bolted in a panic if they had
not been hobbled. At night my friends heard hyenas running within a
dozen yards of their beds.</p>

<p>They had been much interested in watching the huge flocks of
small birds of the linnet kind which assembled half an hour before
sunset and went to drink together in the pools of the Atbara. They
come with an undulating flight, and, small as they are, the rushing
of the wind as they beat the air makes a noise like thunder, and
their numbers darken the sky. The weight of the throngs of them
which alight at a time bends down the ends of the overhanging
branches and twigs to the level of the water. I had seen these
flocks many times, and the cunning trick which the crocodile uses
in preying upon them. This was a point of Soudanese natural history
which did not escape the observation of Sir Samuel Baker.</p>

<p>“Few creatures are so sly and wary as the crocodile. I watch
them continually as they attack the dense flocks of small birds
that throng the bushes at the water’s edge. These birds are
perfectly aware of the danger, and they fly from the attack if
possible. The crocodile then quietly and innocently lies upon the
surface, as though it had appeared quite by an accident; it thus
attracts the attention of the birds, and it slowly sails away to a
considerable distance, exposed to their view. The birds, thus
beguiled by the deceiver, believe that the danger is removed, and
they again flock to the bush, and once more dip their thirsty beaks
into the stream.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
Thus absorbed in slaking their thirst, they do not observe that
their enemy is no longer on the surface. A sudden splash, followed
by a huge pair of jaws beneath the bush that engulfs some dozens of
victims, is the signal unexpectedly given of the crocodile’s
return, who has thus slily dived, and hastened under cover of water
to his victims. I have seen the crocodiles repeat this manœuvre
constantly, they deceive by a feigned retreat, and then attack from
below.”<a id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class=
"fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>These birds fall a prey not only to crocodiles but to large
fish—of what species I am not sure—which rise at them as other
kinds rise at flies and snap them off the twigs. Besides, kites
scout about the outskirts of the flocks as they fly and pick up the
stragglers.</p>

<p>In this part of the country we saw baobab trees only on the
banks of the river. Elsewhere, the trees are all mimosas and the
undergrowth of the same order.</p>

<p>On the 4th we marched over a dead level of cotton soil to an
abandoned village. We had to carry drinking-water, for the well at
this place had been filled up by the Dervishes. I have very little
doubt that this region is full of malaria in the wet season. Our
camp was at the foot of a rocky hill, on which we found abundance
of guinea-fowl when we took out our guns late in the afternoon. On
the following day we saw herd after herd of ariel as we marched.
They were extremely tame, and we passed within ten yards of some of
them. The track which we followed brought us to the Atbara again,
at the hamlet of Aradeeb. This village was poverty-stricken and
almost in a state of famine. The aphis<a id=
"FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class=
"fnanchor">[114]</a><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_194">[194]</span> had blighted the entire dhurra crop of the
inhabitants. I could not discover how the people lived, but they
seemed to bear their trouble uncomplainingly, and here as elsewhere
appeared to be sincerely thankful for the peace and safety which
the Anglo-Egyptian rule secures to them. In every village to which
we came we heard the same remark—“Miri quies,” “the Government is
good.” I believe that this expression of opinion is perfectly
sincere. If so, it is one of the greatest of the many great
triumphs of British administration.</p>

<p>The course of the Atbara is much narrower here than at the point
where we had left it, and the pools are deeper. They are not
connected by a current in the dry season. I judged that the stream
would be from twenty-five to thirty feet deep when the floods are
at their height. The river runs, with a shingly bed, through a
curious formation of coarse, gritty sandstone, which forms fine
cliffs and numerous rocky bars and barriers. The sandstone stratum
extends to about two-thirds of the height of the ravines, and the
upper third consists of the usual black-cotton soil.</p>

<p>When the heat of the day was over I caught a couple of fish of
about three pounds and four pounds weight. They showed some sport
and made very good eating. In the evening we should have rested in
perfect contentment, after enjoying the luxury of a bath, if
insects of various sorts had not swarmed upon us incessantly,
crawling and biting. Dupuis gave the sheikh of the village two
sheep which we had brought from Zegi. They suffered severely from
the heat, and it seemed cruel to drive them further. Besides, we
were glad to add something to the store of the villagers in their
time of scarcity.</p>

<p>On March 6 we quitted Aradeeb. The old sheikh<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> came to our camp to see us
start, and brought us hot coffee in which we ceremonially drank
“peace to the village.” Throughout our journey on this day we
followed the course of the river, constantly crossing gorges and
khors. We reached Sofi at midday. This is the large village near
which Sir Samuel Baker dwelt for five months in 1861. He has given
a very full and most interesting account of the surrounding
district in “The Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia.” There are
rest-huts built of straw at Sofi, and we were glad to take refuge
in them, though the temperature within when we arrived was 107° F.
However, we were able to remove our helmets, and this we could not
do in our tents in the daytime as the sun penetrated the canvas. At
night the temperature was 98° F., and a hot wind was blowing
strongly. Towards evening I had taken my rod to a pool in the
river, but this unpleasant breeze had by that time ruffled the
surface smartly, and I got no sport. I think the fish lie quietly
in shelter during these storms and do not feed.</p>

<p>Next morning we left Sofi, passed through the village of Tomat,
and about midday pitched our camp five miles beyond this place
opposite to the “mugra,” that is the junction of the Settite and
Atbara rivers. The two streams at the point of meeting have a
course about a quarter of a mile broad. The bed of the Atbara is
flat and there is much shingle in it. The sandstone formation has
come to an end, and the rocks which crop up here and there are of a
granitic character. Very little water was flowing in either river,
but a larger stream trickled in the Settite than in the other. We
did not stir far from camp in the afternoon, but shot sand-grouse
as they came to drink in the pools.</p>

<p>During the day we saw tracks of lions, hyenas, and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> monkeys—grivets and baboons.
The soil and the vegetation by the river were such as we had seen
on the previous marches. A lion came into the camp during the
night. We were sleeping in the open and heard him sniffing round
our beds. I sang out to Dupuis, and asked him what was making the
noise. He struck a light, and the beast skulked off into the bush.
My two friends snatched up their rifles and hurried off to see if
he meant to attack the camels. That, no doubt, had been his errand,
for he left us alone, though I saw his tracks within a yard of my
bed next morning. The camels, as usual, were gathered in circles
near the men’s fires. They were hobbled, and I heard them stamping
quickly on the ground in their fright, making a strange pattering
noise. I believe they only show fear in this way when they smell a
lion.</p>

<p>The next day we marched to Khor Katout, a big ravine in the
plain of the Atbara, which extends to the river. A hot wind had
again arisen, and was carrying quantities of dust with it. The
journey was exceedingly unpleasant, and coolness was nowhere to be
found. Khor Katout is a well-known haunt of lions, and we heard
them roaring in the night. On March 10 we arrived at the point
where the road from Gedaref to Kassala joins that on which we were
travelling. Here there is a “nocter”—a military post, where five
soldiers are stationed. At this place we found a rest-hut, in which
we took shelter till three in the afternoon, and then marched on
till six, covering about nine miles in the three hours. Since we
had left the course of the Atbara we had been obliged to send to
the river for water. It was brought in the “fantassis.”<a id=
"FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class=
"fnanchor">[115]</a> This necessity delayed<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_197">[197]</span> us, and added to the petty troubles of
the journey, but we expected to reach the river bed again on the
next day. That night my sleeping-place in the open was within three
or four yards of the track, and the moon was very bright. It was a
most characteristic Eastern sight, when, about nine o’clock, some
thirty camels passed along the route at the foot of my bed, slowly
and silently. They carried no loads, and were probably returning
from Kassala to Gedaref.</p>

<p>On the following day, as we marched, we saw spoor of lions and
leopards among the mingled traces of hyenas, jackals, and many
antelopes. We camped for the night at a very lonely spot on the
Atbara which is called Khashim el Girba.<a id=
"FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class=
"fnanchor">[116]</a> Here the river emerges from a narrow, deep,
rocky gorge where the width of its course in places does not exceed
one hundred and twenty feet. The steep sides have been smoothed by
the terrific rush of water in the rainy season. One of the pools in
the bed of this cataract is very large, and uniformly deep. I
noticed that earth had lodged behind rocks<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_198">[198]</span> which jutted from the sides of the gorge,
and a growth of mimosa scrub had established itself even in the
shallow soil on these ledges. There is no village at Khashim el
Girba, but it is a recognized camping-ground. Beyond the narrows
the Atbara broadens to a width of half a mile, and its course is
divided by an island. Here, at the time of our visit, one could
wade across the river bed through a stream which reached the
ankles. The scene must be one of singular beauty and grandeur when
the floods are coming down from Abyssinia. We heard a lion roaring
at night, and there are numbers around this place, but they had
plenty of game to prey upon and did not approach the camp.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 12 the Berthon boat was put together,
and my companions took her, with some surveying gear, to the great
pool in the gorge. I followed and carried my angling-tackle. We
rowed about half a mile up the course of the river upon this
stretch of water, and then came to the narrowest part of the bed of
the rapids. Here a very large rock that has an accessible side juts
out into the pool, in a most convenient position for survey work,
and my companions began to take measurements, walking up a gravelly
incline which seemed to have been placed there for the purpose.
Their object was to mark out a gauge which would show the rise and
fall of the river during the flood season in this gorge, where, of
course, the movement is very clearly seen. My friends made the
necessary marks in chalk at the time, and these were afterwards
chiselled in the rock by a mason, who was sent down for the
purpose. The gauge has since been connected by electric wire with
Cairo, and since then in flood time the variations in the depth of
the Atbara have been telegraphed every other day to the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> Irrigation Department in the
capital. This has proved to be a very satisfactory arrangement. If
an exceptionally heavy flood occurs, the news is sent to Cairo
immediately; warnings are then dispatched up and down the Nile so
that all concerned may be prepared for the consequent rise of the
river, which will take place, say, in six weeks’ time. The
Irrigation Department and the landowners look to their culverts and
strengthen weak parts of the banks, and all is in readiness when
the flood comes. Formerly it was the custom to patrol the riverside
night and day when an unusual rush of water was expected, but the
risk of disaster in Lower Egypt from this cause has been almost
ended by the operation of the dam at Assuan and the precautions now
taken.</p>

<p>I tried my luck in the pool, where I saw many huge fish, but
they did not bite, though a number smelled at the spoon bait and
some struck at it with their tails. I made attempts with other
attractions, but the copper spoon appeared to allure them most.
Then I cast the line into several pools in vain, but presently, in
the shallower part of the big one, hooked a fish of about four
pounds’ weight, which fought hard, lashing the water, and plunging
and keeping the reel busy. It took me half an hour to play him into
a shallow, and in the meanwhile many big fish came up to see what
was making the disturbance.</p>

<p>I went back to the deeper part of the pool, and as soon as I had
made a cast, hooked one, whose first tug showed that he was a prize
worth landing. I feared that I should lose him, as my tackle was
hardly strong enough for a heavy catch, so I made up my mind to
play him very gently and tire him out, if possible. Away he went
and round spun the wheel. He hid<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_200">[200]</span> under a ledge of rock, and I wound it
gently. This started him again, and now he showed sport without a
break for twenty minutes. After that, to my surprise, I brought him
up quite close to a shallow, and then I saw that I had hooked a
real monster and had a good chance of landing him. But it would be
useless to try to get him ashore without help, and I shouted and
shouted again; for all the time he was making dashes and stopping
in exhaustion, and I was playing him in nearer to the shallow. At
last one of our boys came to aid me, and I saw that he was eager to
help—but the first thing that he did was to rush into the water and
grab my line! I yelled to him to leave it alone and strove to
explain what he was to do. The next time my prize came into the
shallow his strength had nearly failed him, for he rolled over and
showed his white belly. It was a moment of excitement when the
black fellow slipped into the water and tried to catch hold of
<em>the fish’s tail</em>. I did nearly lose him then, but he was
almost spent; and after a great deal of shouting I made the boy
understand at last that he was to put his thumbs into the fish’s
gills on each side. At first he thought I wanted him to put his
fingers into its mouth, and was afraid. It took two men to lift my
fish on to dry ground, and I could hardly believe that the tackle
had held him; I was using a small trout-rod. From snout to tail he
measured forty-five inches, and he had a girth of thirty inches. We
judged his weight to be between fifty and sixty pounds. This
species (<i>lates niloticus</i>) is called by the natives “el
baggar” (the cow). It has been described by Sir S. Baker, who also
published in “The Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia” a drawing of a
fine specimen which he caught in the Atbara. My photograph shows
that the fish which I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_201">[201]</span> landed does not altogether correspond to
his description. It may be that the Soudanese name covers more than
one species, or there may be considerable variation among members
of the same species, but I am inclined to think that the
illustration in Sir S. Baker’s book was prepared from an imperfect
sketch.</p>

<p>During the morning we saw a troop of baboons. For a time they
watched us. It was interesting to note their method of scouting.
Here and there one would climb a tree, scan the surroundings
sharply, and then descend quietly and join the main body. A few
minutes later another would renew the observation from another
tree. In this manner they keep a constant look-out. Mansfield
Parkyns studied the habits of these creatures in Abyssinia and has
given a most interesting account of them.</p>

<p>“The monkeys, especially the Cynocephali, who are astonishingly
clever fellows, have their chiefs, whom they obey implicitly, and a
regular system of tactics in war, pillaging expeditions, robbing
cornfields, etc. These monkey forays are managed with the utmost
regularity and precaution. A tribe, coming down to feed from their
village on the mountain (usually a cleft in the face of some
cliff), brings with it all its members, male and female, old and
young. Some, the elders of the tribe, distinguishable by the
quantity of mane which covers their shoulders, like a lion’s, take
the lead, peering cautiously over each precipice before they
descend, and climbing to the top of every rock or stone which may
afford them a better view of the road before them. Others have
their posts as scouts on the flanks or rear; and all fulfil their
duties with the utmost vigilance, calling out at times, apparently
to keep order among the motley pack which forms the main body, or
to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> notice of
the approach of any real or imagined danger. Their tones of voice
on these occasions are so distinctly varied that a person much
accustomed to watch their movements will at length fancy—and
perhaps with some truth—that he can understand their signals.</p>

<p>“The main body is composed of females, inexperienced males, and
the young people of the tribe. Those of the females who have small
children carry them on their back. Unlike the dignified march of
the leaders, the rabble go along in a most disorderly manner,
trotting on and chattering, without taking the least heed of
anything, apparently confiding in the vigilance of their scouts.
Here a few of the youth linger behind to pick the berries off some
tree, but not long, for the rearguard coming up forces them to
regain their places. There a matron pauses for a moment to suckle
her offspring, and, not to lose time, dresses its hair while it is
taking its meal. Another young lady, probably excited by jealousy
or by some sneering look or word, pulls an ugly mouth at her
neighbour, and then, uttering a shrill squeal highly expressive of
rage, vindictively snatches at her rival’s leg with her hand, and
gives her perhaps a bite in the hind-quarters. This provokes a
retort, and a most unladylike quarrel ensues, till a loud bark of
command from one of the chiefs calls them to order. A single cry of
alarm makes them all halt and remain on the <i>qui vive</i>, till
another bark in a different tone reassures them, and they then
proceed on their march.</p>

<p>“Arrived at the cornfields, the scouts take their position on
the eminences all round, while the remainder of the tribe collect
provision with the utmost expedition, filling their cheek-pouches
as full as they can hold, and then tucking the heads of corn
under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> their
armpits. Now, unless there be a partition of the collected spoil,
how do the scouts feed? for I have watched them several times, and
never observed them to quit for a moment their post of duty till it
was time for the tribe to return, or till some indication of danger
induced them to take flight. They show also the same sagacity in
searching for water, discovering at once the places where it is
most readily found in the sand, and then digging for it with their
hands, just as men would, relieving one another in the work if the
quantity of sand to be removed be considerable.”<a id=
"FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class=
"fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>In the afternoon Crawley shot a wild pig. I walked to the river
again, being charmed by the lovely scenery, and as I approached saw
numbers of crocodiles scuttle into the water. None was of great
size. I doubt if any region in the world affords more varied sport
than the valley of the Atbara. The climate is perfectly healthy in
the dry season.</p>

<p>On March 13 we struck our camp in the afternoon and soon met the
first European whom we had encountered since we left Gallabat. He
was a British officer on the way from Kassala to Gedaref, and he
made mention of the slave-raids which had taken place since we left
the latter place. It seemed likely that the Arab Battalion would be
kept busy in holding the marauders in check. In the course of our
march we crossed the Atbara, at a point where it is about four
hundred yards in breadth. Water that reached our ankles was
trickling among the shingle in places. At sundown we arrived at a
camping-ground called Fashur, and halted for the night. Our dinner
was “bully beef” and pickles—neither a luxurious nor a prudent
meal. We were now suffering from heat eczema, which is most
irritating in the cool<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_204">[204]</span> of the night. The baying of a hyena kept me
awake for hours, and a bed in the Soudan is not a pleasant place
for one who lies on it with an itching skin and listens to that
dismal noise.</p>

<p>Our camp at Fashur was very hot and dusty. In the afternoon of
the next day we started for a march of twenty-two miles, which
would take us half the way from the Atbara to Kassala. We turned
our backs to the river and crossed a plain covered by dried grass
and mimosa scrub, which is probably a swamp during the rainy
season. Our tents were pitched on the open, level ground after an
exhausting journey, at the halting-place ordinarily used by those
who follow this track. There were no habitations, and we saw none
on the road. During the night a detachment of the Arab Battalion
passed our encampment, on its way to protect villages against
slave-raiders.</p>

<p>On March 15 we arrived at the River Gash just outside Kassala.
Its course here lies in a flat, sandy bed, which was quite dry.
During the journey—eighteen and a half miles—we saw eight
ostriches. The Gash, beyond Kassala, splits into numerous small
streams which, even in the rainy season, sink into the ground and
disappear completely. Sir Samuel Baker has given an account of the
river at that time of the year, which shows its importance in
relation to produce and water-supply in the district.</p>

<p>“As we approached within about twenty-five miles of Kassala, I
remarked that the country on our left was in many places flooded;
the Arabs, who had hitherto been encamped in this neighbourhood
during the dry season were migrating to other localities in the
neighbourhood of Soojalup and Gozerajup with their vast herds of
camels and goats. As rain had not fallen in sufficient<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span> quantity to account for the
flood, I was informed that it was due to the river Gash, or Mareb,
which, flowing from Abyssinia, passed beneath the walls of Kassala,
and then divided into innumerable ramifications; it was eventually
lost, and disappeared in the porous soil, after having flooded a
large extent of country. This cause accounted for the never-failing
wells at Soojalup—doubtless a substratum of clay prevented the
total escape of the water, which remained at a depth of forty feet
from the surface. The large tract of country thus annually flooded
by the river Gash is rendered extremely fruitful, and is the resort
of both the Hadendowa and the Hallonga Arabs during the dry season,
who cultivate large quantities of dhurra and other grain.
Unfortunately, in these climates, fertility of soil is generally
combined with unhealthiness, and the commencement of the rainy
season is the signal for fevers and other maladies.”<a id=

<p>We were now close to the curious and isolated eminence called
Kassala Hill, which stands within the border-line of the colony of
Eritrea. We had seen this towering landmark when we were more than
forty miles distant from it, and a whole day’s travelling had
seemed to bring us no nearer to it. It offers a splendid sight in
the desert, when the setting sun shines on the bare pile of red
granite. I was told that in the days when the Italians occupied
Kassala, Alpine climbers, with elaborate paraphernalia, had
attempted the ascent, but failed in all cases to reach the summit.
There is a superstition among the natives that any one who tries to
scale the heights will die shortly afterwards, and this belief has
been confirmed among them by the death of Colonel Collinson, a
former Moudir of the town,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_206">[206]</span> who made the last endeavour of which I
heard, and succumbed to fever six months afterwards.</p>

<p>We rose early next morning (March 16) and visited the British
officers at the Moudirieh. Needless to say we were in touch with a
civilized <i>cuisine</i> again, and nothing teaches a man to
appreciate a good lunch in a cool room like a journey in the
desert. In the afternoon I visited the hospital, which was in
charge of Dr. Ensor. It is a most instructive place to a medical
man; for here patients are gathered together from all parts of the
Eastern Soudan. And it affords a proof of the benefits of
Anglo-Egyptian administration that is beyond cavil. I saw cases of
many interesting tropical diseases, about which the doctor and I
had a long talk in the evening. We dined at the mess of the 11th
Battalion of the Egyptian army—once more among our
fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>On the next day we visited Cristo’s, the Whiteley’s of Kassala,
and made purchases for the remainder of the journey. At sundown I
watched the 11th at tattoo. This regiment had a good band, composed
of Soudanese blacks, and it gave one a lively pleasure to hear
European music again, though I must admit that they played the Old
Hundredth arranged as a march! In the evening the Governor had a
dinner-party in honour of St. Patrick’s-day, and a number of
officers were present. The place might have been an Indian station
instead of Kassala.</p>

<p>On March 18 my companions left the camp very early, accompanied
by another English soldier who was visiting the town, to make an
inspection of the bed of the Gash above Kassala. In the evening
they rode out in the opposite direction to see the end of its
course in the tract in which it is absorbed. Possibly
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span> subterranean
waters, free from evaporation, will afford an invaluable reservoir
for irrigation and the maintenance of stock in the future.</p>

<p>The Governor of Kassala had a small black servant, about
thirteen years of age, called Fadl Mullah (Courtesy of the
Prophet). The lad had been picked up in a deserted Dervish trench
during the battle of the Atbara, where he was found tied to a dead
camel and covered with blood. The Governor told us that he was “as
sharp as a needle” and most zealous in service, never sleeping in
the afternoon, and always running when he was sent upon an errand.
He only gave trouble in one way, and this was that once in every
two months or so he would come to the Moudir and declare that he
had found his father. When the putative parent had disclaimed the
bond, and the Governor had said that he would hear no more about
it, the boy would acquiesce. But he was sure to discover another
“father” a few weeks later.</p>

<p>While we were at Kassala an Italian officer arrived in the town
from Eritrea. No one had received notice of his coming, and no one
seemed to know what his business was. I sat next to him one night
at dinner, and he told me that he was a lieutenant in the Mountain
Artillery, and was using his leave to make a journey to the
junction of the Atbara and Settite Rivers. He would return thence
direct to his battery.</p>

<p>On the 20th we struck our camp and left Kassala in the
afternoon, turning our faces towards the Atbara again. We had the
pleasure of the company of the Governor and another English officer
during the next two days’ journeys, which were hot, tiring, and
uneventful. We bade farewell to our friends on the afternoon of the
22nd. On the following day we marched in the direction of the Goz
Regeb hill. This singular rise of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_208">[208]</span> ground in the desert appeared and
disappeared as we moved down imperceptible slopes and then ascended
again. We saw the mirage all around us. The soil in this region was
shingly. At Goz Regeb there was a two-roomed rest-house. It was of
baked mud, and was the most solid building that we had seen since
we left Khartoum. We had been told at Kassala that it belonged to
the Slavery Department, and that we might make use of it as it was
then unoccupied. That night there was a high wind, and among its
<i>ludibria</i>, was Crawley’s sponge, which, oddly enough, was
found next day in the Atbara about half a mile from our
halting-place.</p>

<p>On March 24 Dupuis climbed Goz Regeb Hill and took photographs
of the curious balanced granite blocks which stand upon it. At a
distance many of them look like figures of men, and at a nearer
range like worn statues. But it is certain that they have not been
placed in their position by human agency. I am unable to offer any
conjecture as to their origin or geological relation to their
surroundings.</p>

<p>An incursion of great numbers of Arabs from the south, with
their flocks and herds, into the region around Goz Regeb takes
place regularly at the commencement of the rainy season. They are
then compelled to come to this district to avoid the seroot

all live stock except goats. Obviously, this necessary migration is
an important fact both in relation to politics and campaigning in
the Soudan. Sir S. Baker came in contact with the movement
northward.</p>

<p>“The commencement of the rainy season was a warning to all the
Arabs of this country, who were preparing for their annual
migration to the sandy and firm desert on the west bank of the
river, at Gozerajup; that region, so barren and desolate during the
hot season, would shortly be covered with a delicate grass about
eighteen inches high. At that favoured spot the rains fell with
less violence, and it formed a nucleus for the general gathering of
the people with their flocks.</p>

<p>“The burning sun, that for nine months had scorched the earth,
was veiled by passing clouds; the cattle that had panted for water,
and whose food was withered straw, were filled with juicy fodder;
the camels that had subsisted upon the dried and leafless twigs and
branches, now feasted upon the succulent tops of the mimosas.
Throngs of women and children mounted upon camels, protected by the
peculiar gaudy saddle hood, ornamented with cowrie shells,
accompanied the march: thousands of sheep and goats, driven by Arab
boys, were straggling in all directions; baggage-camels, heavily
laden with the quaint household gods, blocked up the way; and fine
bronzed figures of Arabs, with sword and shield, and white topes or
plaids, guided their milk-white dromedaries through the confused
throng with the usual placid dignity of their race, simply passing
by with the usual greeting, ‘<em>Salaam Aleikum</em>’ (Peace be
with you).</p>

<p>“It was the Exodus; all were hurrying towards the promised
land—the ‘land flowing with milk and honey,’<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_210">[210]</span> where men and beasts would be secure not
only from the fevers of the south, but from that deadly enemy to
camels and cattle, <em>the fly</em>; this terrible insect drove all
before it.”<a id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class=
"fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>During the wet season the Mouderir (Government) of Kassala is
transferred to new buildings which have recently been erected for
its reception at the village of Goz Regeb, and there is a general
movement of the Europeans and the wealthier native inhabitants of
the town to the same place. The exercise of jurisdiction and the
collection of revenue in this region are made difficult by the
annual migration of which Sir Samuel Baker wrote. Great numbers of
people from different parts of the country collect now, as in
former days, within one district in a very short space of time, the
comminglement of flocks and herds adds to the confusion, and it is
no simple administrative task to deal with a shifting population of
this magnitude. If the seroot fly were exterminated, as certain
species of noxious African mosquitoes have been, this yearly exodus
would no longer take place.</p>

<p>On March 25, we camped beside the river at a pleasant place well
shaded by trees. I took my rod to a pool and landed a couple of
fish, one about six pounds and the other twelve pounds in weight.
They were of the same species as my fifty-pound prize, and both
showed fight. They came into shallow water after plenty of coaxing,
and I got them ashore without aid. My experience that evening shows
that a diary is kept with difficulty in the Soudan. I sat on my bed
to write the notes of the day, and held a candle aloft in my left
hand to keep it out of reach of the draughts which blew the flame
in all directions if I lowered it. With the right hand I
used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> my pencil, and
kept clearing away the insects that flew upon my face and swarmed
about the light. They seemed to exercise no choice, but flew
indifferently into one’s mouth or eyes or into the flame, and they
were nastiest when moribund, but still active, after resolutely
passing through the fire.</p>

<p>On the 26th we halted, after marching from five in the morning
till eleven, at a spot a few miles distant from the river, where
there are three rest-houses—one for the chiefs of the party which
is travelling, one for the servants, and one to serve as kitchen.
Gazelles were plentiful in this district, but we were unable to use
our rifles on account of the throng of Arabs, cattle, and sheep in
the neighbourhood. It was interesting to watch the manner in which
the goats feed at this season. They are tended by half-naked
Soudanese boys who carry long crooked staves. With these they pull
down the branches of the mimosas, and the goats browse the leaves
and twigs. They also stand upon their hind legs, resting their
forelegs upon boughs, and so reach the foliage, keeping the
branches down with their hoofs, while they eat the succulent new
shoots. When they are seen from a distance in this attitude they
exactly resemble people. In this region the villages are very
small—mere hamlets consisting of a few huts, and very little ground
is under cultivation. The land is used for pasture throughout the
district, and is apparently common to all comers.</p>

<p>On March 27, we travelled about thirteen miles and halted at a
rest-house. We had reached a zone of lower temperature—the maximum
at midday was 89°—and the journeys were no longer unpleasant. The
riverside scenery is interesting and beautiful in the lower as well
as in the higher reaches, and the dome-palms<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_212">[212]</span> become more numerous as one advances
northward and add to the charm of the banks. There was no other
vegetation when we saw the country except low-grown mimosas and
mimosa-scrub. Sand stretches away on either side from the course of
the river, and we crossed few khors after leaving Goz Regeb, for
the rainfall in this region is absorbed in the soil and is
insufficient to produce torrents which would scour a course towards
the stream.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I took my fishing-tackle and tried my fortune
in a pool from which I landed two fish, one of about fifteen pounds
and one of about five pounds, and a crocodile tried his luck upon
the bank and nearly caught a man. Before I set out with my rod I
had been warned by the sheikh of the village near which we had
encamped that the beasts were very dangerous in this part of the
Atbara, and I kept a good look-out for signs of them. It happened,
however, that just as I had made a cast, Dupuis, who had been out
with his rifle, passed behind me and sang out, “Have you caught
anything?” I stepped back briskly, as good luck would have it, and
answered, “Have <em>you</em> shot anything?” and at the instant the
crocodile lashed at my legs with its tail to strike me into the
water. It had been awaiting its chance to take me off my guard, and
I had had no inkling of danger. I judged the length of the reptile
to be about twelve feet. It certainly had a sound sporting plan and
made a smart dash; for it only missed me by a few inches. The tails
of these creatures are very powerful, and if the one that had been
stalking me had judged distance a little better, I should certainly
have been knocked into the pool.</p>

<p>A little later I heard in Cairo that a week after my adventure,
a woman, who was filling a water-sack close<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_213">[213]</span> to the place where I had stood, turned
round to answer some men who were exchanging chaff with her; as she
did so, a crocodile struck her on the hip with its tail, lashed her
some distance into the water, and immediately dragged her under. I
was told that they use the tail-trick only with human beings and
always seize beasts by the snout. But this account does not quite
agree with the observations of Sir S. Baker, who made a very
careful study of the habits of the crocodiles in the rivers of the
Soudan.</p>

<p>“The crocodile perceives, while it is floating on the surface in
mid stream, or from the opposite side of the river, a woman filling
her girba,<a id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class=
"fnanchor">[121]</a> or an animal drinking, etc. Sinking
immediately, it swims perhaps a hundred yards nearer, and again
appearing for an instant upon the surface, it assures itself of the
position of its prey by a stealthy look; once more it sinks, and
reaches the exact spot above which the person or animal may be.
Seeing distinctly through the water, it generally makes its fatal
rush from beneath—sometimes seizing with its jaws, and at other
times striking the object into the water with its tail, after which
it is seized and carried off.</p>

<p>“The crocodile does not attempt to swallow a large prey at once,
but generally carries it away, and keeps it for a considerable time
in its jaws in some deep hole beneath a rock, or the root of a
tree, where it eats it at leisure.”<a id=
"FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class=
"fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The fish which I had caught were of the same species as those
which I had previously landed, and proved very good at table in the
evening. It was our custom to dress for dinner—in pyjamas.</p>

<p>On March 28 our journey lay through the desert,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span> and reminded us of our first
marches towards Gedaref. The river banks with their dome palms were
the only landmark. Elsewhere nothing was to be seen but sand, with
patches of thinly-growing, very coarse grass or low mimosa scrub
here and there, and mirage all around us.</p>

<p>Next day we travelled twenty-one miles to Adarama. On the way we
passed at a distance a great zareba prepared by Osman Digna. This
was protected by double walls, each about twelve feet high. There
is an interval of some three feet between the two. They enclose a
square space of sandy ground, and the sides have a length of about
three hundred yards. The Dervish leader intended to occupy it after
the battle of the Atbara. The defences are now slowly falling to
pieces; for the walls are made of sun-dried mud, and as this
becomes weatherworn and crumbles the wind carries it away, leaving
gaps in the ramparts. The sight symbolizes much. Adarama was
formerly one of the large towns of the Soudan, but now consists of
a few mud huts. There is also a small garrison of about twenty
soldiers. The place lies halfway between Gozerajup and Berber, and
has a pleasant rest-house among the palm-trees close to the river.
The bed of the Atbara is sandy here, and the average breadth is
about four hundred yards.</p>

<p>On March 30 we reached Gumaza. I had the luck to bring down a
fine buck gazelle while we were on the road. In the evening Dupuis
and I made practice at the crocodiles in the river, and their
numbers were shown by the commotion that they made in the pools.
The next day we pushed on across the desert towards Berber and
slept in the open. On April 1 our road lay through similar country.
Sometimes a gazelle would scamper away in the distance, but often
nothing was to be seen but sand and mirage. And then suddenly we
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> confronted by
vestiges of civilization. When we were not far from the Atbara
battle-field we saw the unmistakable traces of a traction engine.
About eleven o’clock dome palms were in sight, and we reached a
rest-house beside the river half an hour later. After lunch we
heard the jerky puffing of a petrol motor, and rushed out to see
what was approaching. It was a heavy engine dragging a car, and the
tracks which we had discerned were accounted for. The Englishman in
charge told us that he had carried a tombstone to the battlefield;
it had been erected on an officer’s grave. He added that he could
travel six miles an hour in the desert, but that petrol was very
expensive in Berber, where it cost ten shillings a gallon; so he
had come to the rest-house to await a troop of forty mules, which
were to drag the engine and car back to the town.</p>

<p>On April 2 we reached the bridge over the Atbara—<i>monumentum
ære perennius</i>, if Lord Kitchener’s energy and perseverance
receive their deserts from posterity. It was strange to us to see a
railway train, and hear the whistle of a locomotive once more. On
the next day we arrived at Berber. Here we were in full contact
with civilization, and here, practically, the duties of the
expedition ended, for we followed the ordinary train and steamer
route to our journey’s end. Here, too, I will take leave of my
reader, hoping that the long excursion from Khartoum has not
wearied him, and will only add my conviction that a splendid future
lies before the Eastern Soudan, and before Abyssinia,
<em>after</em> the clouds have gathered over that country and
burst.</p>

weapon. Some, if straight, would be nearly four feet long; they are
two-edged, and curved to a semicircle, like a reaper’s sickle. It
is a very clumsy weapon to manage. Many of the swords are made of
the soft iron of the country and bend on the least stress. The
handles are made of the horn of the rhinoceros, sawn into three
longitudinal pieces, and incised so as to end in sharp points
parallel to the blades. The shank is usually clinched over a
half-dollar beaten convex. I should scarcely mind a blow from a
sword thus mounted, as, were the striker to give his wrist any
play, in order to make his cut at all effective, he could not fail
sending one of the highly ornamental but very useless points of his
hilt into his own wrist. . . . In the use of the gun the natives
are in general exceedingly clumsy. They prefer large, heavy
matchlocks, to load which is a labour of some minutes. They carry
their powder in hollow canes fitted into a leathern belt worn round
the waist; and, having no fixed charge, pour out at hazard a small
quantity into the hand. This they measure with the eye,
occasionally putting back a little if it appear too much, or adding
a little if it seem not enough. After this operation has been
performed two or three times, till they are pretty well satisfied
as to the quantity, it is poured into the gun-barrel. The proper
charge is now tested by the insertion of the ramrod. Lastly, when
all is settled, some rag and a small bar or ball of roughly wrought
iron are rammed down. This last operation (with the exception that
the ramrod often sticks in the rag for half an hour) is not
difficult, as the ball is made of about a quarter of an inch less
diameter than the bore of the piece for which it is intended. It is
great fun to see these gunners, when taken unawares by a sudden
alarm; one can’t find his flint, another has lost his steel; then
there is the striking of a light, blowing the match, priming the
gun, fixing the match to a proper length and direction; and,
lastly, sticking into the ground the rest, which nearly all of them
use, especially if their piece be of the heavy description. There
is one thing in their favour—that the mere sound of driving in the
rest is generally sufficient to turn away the bravest Abyssinian
cavalry that ever charged.”—Mansfield Parkyns, pp. 236, 241.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22"><span class=
"label">[22]</span></a>Mansfield Parkyns has given a full and
careful description of the national costume. I extract the
following details from it:—“The ‘quarry’ is the principal article
of Abyssinian dress: it is of cotton, and very fine and soft; those
of the richer being finer but probably not so serviceable as those
of the poorer class. It is made in three pieces; each piece is
about three feet broad by fifteen feet long. Near both ends of each
piece is a red stripe, five or six inches broad.” The pieces are
sewn together so as to form “a white double cloth, with a red
border near the bottom only; the breadth of the ‘quarry’ is nine
feet by seven and a half long. . . . The methods of putting on the
cloth are as various as the modes of wearing a Highland plaid. One
of the most ordinary ways is first to place it like a cloak over
the shoulders: the right end, which is purposely left the longer,
is then thrown over the left shoulder, and the bottom border, which
would otherwise (from its length) trail on the ground, is gathered
over the right shoulder” (“Life in Abyssinia,” pp. 228, 229). “The
trousers are of a soft textured but rather coarse cotton stuff,
made in the country, and are of two sorts: one called ‘cállis,’ the
other ‘coumta.’ The former reaches half-way down the calf of the
leg, the latter to about three or four inches above the knee” (ib.
pp. 225, 226). The other garment worn by the men is a belt. These
cinctures “vary in length from fifteen to sixty yards, and are
about one yard in width. In quantity of cotton they are nearly all
of the same weight, as the very long ones are in proportion finer
than the shorter” (ib. p. 227). With regard to feminine dress,
“there is a distinguishing costume for young girls, and for those
who, from being married or otherwise, are no longer considered as
such. The dress of the former is indeed rather slight, though far
more picturesque than that of the latter. . . . The girls merely
wear a piece of cotton stuff wrapped round the waist and hanging
down almost to the knee, and another (or the end of the former, if
it be long enough) thrown over the left shoulder, so as to leave
the right arm and breast exposed. In other parts of Tigre a black
goat-skin, ornamented with cowries, is often substituted for this
latter. An ordinary woman wears a large loose shirt down to the
feet, with sleeves made tight towards the wrist. This, with a
‘quarry’ similar to those of the men, but worn rather differently,
and a parasol when out of doors, is a complete suit” (ib. pp.
241-243). Parkyns thus describes the system of hairdressing: “In
general, neither sex wears any covering on the head, preferring to
tress and butter that with which nature has provided them. The hair
of the Abyssinians is admirably adapted for this purpose, being
neither short and crisp like a negro’s, nor yet of the soft
elasticity of a European’s, but between the two. . . . The
operation of tressing is a very tedious one, usually occupying an
hour or two per head: therefore, of course, it is repeated as
seldom as possible: by some great dandies once a fortnight: by
others once a month, or even less frequently. In the interim large
supplies of fresh butter are employed, when obtainable, in order to
prevent the chance of a settlement of vermin; and a piece of stick,
like a skewer, is used for scratching. The hair is gathered in
plaits close over the whole surface of the head, the lines running
fore and aft, and the ends hanging down in ringlets over the neck.
. . . Some ladies have their butter daubed on nicely, and then some
scent: but the great ‘go’ among the dandies is to appear in the
morning with a huge pat of butter (about two ounces) placed on the
top of the head, which, as it gradually melts in the sun, runs over
the hair and down the neck, over the forehead, and often into the
eyes, thereby causing much smarting. This last ingression, however,
the gentleman usually prevents by wiping his forehead frequently
with his hand or the corner of his ‘quarry.’ As may be imagined,
the dresses neither of the women nor men are long free from grease;
but this, especially among the latter sex, is of no importance;
indeed, many young men among the soldiery consider a clean cloth as
‘slow,’ and appropriate only for a townsman or a woman. These never
have their quarries washed from one St. John’s Day to another” (ib.
pp. 243-245).</p>

We were resting one night near the summit of a mountain, when about
two hours before daybreak we were awaked by a loud hubbub and the
discharge of a gun. Starting to our feet, we inquired what was up,
and our anxiety was increased by M. Lejean’s Arab seizing the
second gun and discharging it. All I saw, for it was pitch dark,
was one of the mules kicking about amongst the ashes of a
half-extinguished fire, and endeavouring to extricate himself from
the leather thong which bound his head to a tree. This he soon
succeeded in doing, and went off at a furious rate towards the
woods which clothe the sides of the mountain. I thought he had
burnt himself at the fire, and that this was the cause of his
breaking loose, but the rest maintained that he had been bitten by
the hyenas: and they were right, for at daybreak we saw and gave
chase to one of these brutes, who was still prowling about. These
creatures were much bolder here than near the villages. As we were
sleeping in the open air, with our faces exposed, it was fortunate
for us that the hyenas preferred trying mule’s flesh to man’s. We
heard afterwards that the mule had returned to Gallabat, a distance
of forty miles, but was so severely bitten in the flank that he was
perfectly useless.” (Dufton, “A Journey through Abyssinia,” pp. 48,
49.)</p>

mixture of various qualities of corn goes by that name in some of
the provinces of Tigre. It is supposed by some that a great number
of Jews followed the Queen of Sheba, on her return from her visit
to Solomon, and that a large colony of fugitives also took refuge
in Abyssinia about the time of the destruction of the temple and
the captivity. Subsequently the Greeks sent missionaries, and they
were doubtless accompanied by adventurers; and the Portuguese sent
a number of troops, some of whom remained in the country for many
years. The variety of complexion, observable in both sexes, is, I
should think, attributable to the mixture of races of which the
nation is composed.” (Mansfield Parkyns, “Life in Abyssinia,” p.

Samuel Baker, once put an ant-hill of this kind to a singular use.
The incident may be new to some of my readers. The explorer wished
to make soap in the Soudan. “I had neither lime nor potash, but I
shortly procured both. The hegleek-tree (<i>Balanites
Egyptiaca</i>) was extremely rich in potash; therefore I burned a
large quantity, and made a strong ley with the ashes; this I
concentrated by boiling. There was no lime-stone; but the river
produced a plentiful supply of large oyster-shells, that, if
burned, would yield excellent lime. Accordingly I constructed a
kiln, with the assistance of the white ants. The country was
infested with these creatures, which had erected their dwellings in
all directions; these were formed of clay so thoroughly cemented by
a glutinous preparation of the insects, that it was harder than
sun-baked brick. I selected an egg-shaped hill, and cut off the
top, exactly as we take off the slice from an egg. My Tokrooris
then worked hard, and with a hoe and their lances, they hollowed it
out to the base, in spite of the attacks of the ants, which
punished the legs of the intruders considerably. I now made a
draught-hole from the outside base, at right-angles with the bottom
of the hollow cone. My kiln was perfect.” (“The Nile Tributaries of
Abyssinia,” pp. 424, 425.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36"><span class=

Maria Theresa dollar is a facsimile of the coin of 1780. It is
still issued by the Austrian Government, and circulates as a trade
coin nearly all over Africa. Though roughly about the size of a
five-shilling piece, it only exchanges for a little more than its
intrinsic value, which was about 1<em>s.</em> 11<em>d.</em> when I
left Africa.” (“Abyssinia,” by Herbert Vivian, 1901, p. 239.)
Dufton wrote, with regard to Abyssinian marketing: “The Maria
Theresa dollar is the only coin used in these transactions under
the name of <em>bir</em> (silver). This piece must be of a certain
kind, however, containing the spots which form the queen’s tiara,
and other marks clearly defined; for which reason it is called by
the Arabs of the Soudan Abou Nukter, or father of spots.” (“A
Journey through Abyssinia,” p. 61.) Mr. Vivian gives the following
table of Abyssinian currency:—</p>

<table class="tdl">
<tr>
<td>4 cartridges</td>
<td>= 1 salt</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>4 salts</td>
<td>= 1 Maria Theresa dollar</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="nind">The “salt” is a bar of that mineral, which is
ordinarily carried and used in lieu of coin. I found that its value
was, roughly, sixpence, as Mr. Vivian says. At an earlier date its
purchasing power seems to have been less. “Pieces of salt, called
<em>tsho</em>, are the monetary medium throughout the greater part
of Abyssinia. This salt is obtained from extensive mines in the
country of the Danakil, where it is cut into small blocks, eight
inches long by one inch and a half in breadth, each of which is of
a variable market value of between twopence and threepence.” (“A
Journey through Abyssinia,” pp. 61, 62.) Evidently there has been
“appreciation of salt” in the land of the Negus since 1862, when
Mr. Dufton visited it.</p>

incidents of his recent expedition to the upper reaches of the Blue
Nile, told an interviewer: “We were roused at four in the morning
by the wild screams of one of our people (a Somali), who had been
seized by a big crocodile, which had crawled up the rocks. The
brute had seized his victim by the head and dragged him to the
water’s edge. By throwing stones at the crocodile we succeeded in
making him leave the Somali, who, though terribly mauled,
eventually recovered.”—<em>Egyptian Gazette</em>, October 21, 1903.
Mr. MacMillan told me subsequently in conversation that the Somali,
when he was attacked, was sleeping with his head on his arm, and
that the crocodile seized both head and arm, with the result that
the Somali put his finger in the crocodile’s eye. Mr. MacMillan was
inclined to believe that this action made the reptile release the
man. The guns and ammunition of the expedition had all been lost,
and were at the bottom of the river, and the night was pitch
dark.</p>

is ‘teff’ and ‘dágousha,’ if, indeed, we may venture to include

seed. Of each of these there are various qualities, esteemed
according to their colour, white, red, or black. White ‘teff’ bread
is preferred by all natives even to wheat bread. . . . The ‘teff’
is considered by the Abyssinians wholesome and digestible; but so
far from being satisfied of this, I am doubtful of its containing
much nutritious property; and as for its taste, only fancy yourself
chewing a piece of sour sponge, and you will have a good idea of

<em>tedj</em>, but even the ladies of the land did so in Bruce’s
time. He was in Gondar when “Ozoro Esther’s sister, the Iteghe’s”
(queen-mother’s) “youngest daughter was married to Powussen, the
governor of Begemder. The king gave her large districts of land in
that province, and Ras Michael a large portion of gold, muskets,
cattle, and horses.” On this occasion “the Ras, Ozoro Esther, and
Ozoro Altash entertained all Gondar. A vast number of cattle were
slaughtered every day, and the whole town was one great market: the
common people, in every street, appeared laden with pieces of raw
beef, while drink circulated in like profusion. The Ras insisted
upon Bruce’s dining with him every day. After dinner they slipped
away to parties of ladies, where anarchy prevailed as completely as
at the house of the Ras. All the married women ate, drank and
smoked like the men; in fact it is impossible to convey to the
English reader, in terms of proper decency, any idea of this
bacchanalian scene” (Head’s “Life of Bruce,” pp. 297, 298). In
Parkyns’s time a wedding-feast was an orgy of the same kind for all
classes and both sexes. And as there is a complete absence of
<i>gêne</i> in the conduct of modern Abyssinian women in other
respects, I have little doubt that they still favour the

which consist of porphyry and trachyte, in which calcareous tufa is
found embedded. Its banks are adorned with tropical vegetation, and
the place derives its characteristic features especially from the
wild <i>Phœnix</i> with its delicate foliage and the colossal
<i>Musa Ensete ornamentalis</i> with carmine leaf-panicles, which
is called <em>guma-guma</em> by the natives to distinguish it from
the edible <i>Musa Ensete</i>. In many places the Gumara is deep
and full of fish; innumerable wild ducks and geese, <i>scopus
umbretta</i>, etc., enliven the surface of the water, while
bright-hued butterflies, the charming <i>Danais</i> and equitidæ
with their brilliant play of colour, mingled with tiny
metallic-tinted nectariniæ (<i>affinis metallica</i>), flit around
the fragrant <i>Dodonæa viscosa</i> and the brilliant blossoms of
the Tsana-tree” (“Mittheilungen der Afrikanischen Gesellschaft in

name given to a family of pinnate palms, of which the Egyptian
<i>Phœnix dactylifera</i>, the finger-date, is an example.
<i>Ensete</i> is the Abyssinian name of a thick-stemmed,
large-leafed banana, which is grown in gardens as an ornamental
plant. The thick flower-stalk is used as an article of food by the
natives, but the fruit, being small and dry, is useless. In spite
of these attractions, Wansage, (see p. 63) according to Stecker,
would hardly be a suitable health-resort for European invalids. He
wrote, “By night an infernal din prevails, which, mingled with the
singing of women and clapping of hands, forms the characteristic
music of the Baths. The bull-frogs that live in the Gumara supply a
harmonious accompaniment, which, with the noise kept up by the
donkeys and beasts of burden, does not cease till long after

and by whole nests of olive-green <i>Viscum</i>, and another
parasitical plant which is peculiar to this one tree; and they are
surrounded by an impenetrable growth of <i>Cucurbitaceæ</i> and
<i>Convolvulaceæ</i>, which in some places form the most romantic
piazzas, and in others arbours and formal galleries, and afford the
coolest shade. This Lamge is a place for which one may prophesy a
brilliant future. Everywhere hereabouts on ancient acacias hang the
nests of weaver-birds (<i>textor alecto</i>), and, out of
curiosity, I counted upon one of them 872 basket-shaped, suspended
nests” (“Mittheilungen der Afrikanischen Gesellschaft in

his head, reading the Psalms. He asked me many questions on
geography, and unlike the majority of Abyssinian savants did not
believe that beyond Jerusalem the sun never shone, and that only
serpents and other venomous reptiles occupied the untenanted land.
I was told that whenever <em>Atzee Johannes</em> visits King
Theodore, the latter stands before him, as an acknowledgment of his
title to a crown which he could not defend. He receives an annual
pension from the Royal Treasury” (“Wanderings among the Falashes in

(“Mittheilungen,” p. 23). As far as my experience goes, this
overstates the case a little, but the complete disregard of
morality by both sexes—a matter about which the clergy do not
trouble themselves—has rendered disease of this kind extremely
common. The pest of internal parasites, which is the bane of all
classes of Abyssinians, and is almost universal among them, is
undoubtedly due to their disgusting habit of eating raw meat. They
devour flesh warm and quivering from the newly slaughtered carcase,
and Bruce asserted that in his time they habitually cut the meat
from the living animal, and continued to do so until it bled to
death. This would be an unusual barbarity, and Parkyns saw no
instance of it, though he believed Bruce’s statement to have been
true when he made it (“Life in Abyssinia,” p. 204). Mr. Wylde has
given another explanation of what Bruce observed (“Modern
Abyssinia,” p. 153). But, whatever may be the fact as to this
particular, the habit of eating uncooked flesh prevails everywhere
in the country. I noticed that the ceremonial practices of the
Mussulmans appeared to save them both from tænia and scabies. But,
in spite of their ablutions, they are infested, like the rest of
the inhabitants, with body lice. Mohammedans are regarded with
disdain by the Christian Abyssinians, and the prejudice against
them, as I have said, accounts for some of the uncleanliness of the
Christians. To wash much or regularly is to behave like a
Mussulman.</p>

general description of the lake district embodied by Mr. Dupuis in
his Report on the Expedition, and published in Sir W. Garstin’s
Despatch already cited (Ed. 2165, 1904, p. 215), is terse and
interesting:</p>

<p>“The depression occupied by the lake is, generally speaking,
saucer-shaped, the land rising from the edge of the water in gentle
undulating plains, getting steeper and steeper and terminating in
considerable hills or mountains of some importance. In several
places, as at Gorgora on the north, Mitraha and Koratsa on the
east, Zegi on the south, and Dengelber on the west, the hills come
right down to the lake and descend more or less abruptly into the
water, but more often they stand back at some distance from it. The
geological formation is almost everywhere of the same primitive
character that seems to be universal in the Eastern Soudan,
granite, gneiss, and quartz, varied only by tracts of lava, basalt,
and eruptive rocks. Sandstone is reported by some travellers, and
lime-stone is said to be found near Gondar, but I saw neither
myself. The large tracts of comparatively level land consist almost
entirely of the cracked black cotton soil usually found associated
with igneous rocks. At the mouths of all the larger rivers flowing
into the lake are extensive alluvial plains generally composed
wholly of this same cotton soil, and of the greatest fertility,
though nine-tenths of their area now grows nothing more valuable
than coarse grass.”</p>

watering-place, the Atbara flows in a narrow deep trench, perfectly
straight for a couple of miles or so, with a width of little over
one hundred metres, and a depth of about ten metres all across the
pool when at summer level. The sides of this trench are nearly
vertical cliffs of extremely hard granitic rock rising twenty
metres or more from the water. At the meshra this trench suddenly
fans out into a wide shallow channel, the pool ceases, and the
river breaks up into three or four separate branches, amidst a
confusion of rocky islands, and is not fully re-united into a
single stream for several miles. The rocky substratum through which
the river has cut its way here gives little or no indication of its
presence in the level uplands, which continue as before to form an
unbroken bush-covered plain of black soil up to within a couple of
miles or so of the river, where it suddenly breaks into
ravines.”</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span><a id=
"app1"></a>A NOTE ON THE RELIGION, CUSTOMS, <span class=
"sc">Etc.</span>, OF ABYSSINIA</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">In</span> <em>The Pall Mall
Gazette</em> of August 19, 1904, an interesting account of an
interview with M. Hugues Leroux was published. M. Leroux had just
returned from a “diplomatic and scientific mission” to Abyssinia.
He had been the bearer of an autograph letter from M. Loubet to the
Emperor Menelek. M. Leroux brought back much interesting
information which concerns only the present circumstances of the
country—<i>e.g.</i> that the Emperor “is striving to follow out
what he himself calls a policy of good-humour. He wants to be on
good terms with all the world, but he does not want to be devoured.
He is anxious to open up Abyssinia, but to commerce, not to
conquest.” And again, “he has at last granted permission for the
railway from Djibouti, which hitherto went only as far as Harrar,
to be carried up to Addis Abiba. He will probably refuse the
British and Italian requests to build branch lines connecting this
railway with Zeila and Massouah, the towns on the coast to the
north and the south of Djibouti which belong respectively to Great
Britain and Italy, his comment upon this scheme being, ‘I would
like one ladder up to my front door, but not three.’”</p>

<p>M. Leroux had been entrusted with an autograph reply from the
Emperor Menelek to the President of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_217">[217]</span> the French Republic. But he bore away from
Ethiopia a much more interesting document, which—if it is genuine
and is rightly described by the traveller and the interviewer—is
invaluable for the clue that it gives to the origin of the
Abyssinian nation. It is said to be “a most extraordinary
Abyssinian manuscript, which is certain to make a great sensation
when the translation of it is published, for it throws a flood of
light upon the early history of the Jews. The Abyssinian monarchs
have always considered this manuscript to be among their most
sacred possessions. It was appropriated by the English at the
capture of Magdala, but on Emperor John succeeding to the throne,
he opened diplomatic negotiations and recovered it from the British
Museum, where it had been deposited. It is written in the Geez
language, which is of Hebraic origin, of great antiquity, and known
only to the priests. It relates that after the plagues of Egypt
some hundreds of thousands of Jews did not follow Moses across the
Red Sea, but went west, down the Blue Nile, to found a kingdom of
their own, which they called Saba—‘Saba’ merely meaning west. These
were the original Abyssinians.”</p>

<p>We are told that “the original of this manuscript had remained
seventeen hundred years in an island of Lake Zouai, whose
inhabitants are still of the purest Jewish type, but they were
Christianized at a very early date, and their religion has now
degenerated into fetishism. They knew nothing as to the contents of
the manuscript, which they nevertheless regarded as a very precious
object.” Whatever may be the real antiquity of this document its
existence and the importance attributed to it seem to give evidence
of a tradition of great age, and this tradition offers a credible
explanation of the fact that such a people as the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> Abyssinian is found in the
mountains of East Africa. No doubt the Habashes are now, almost
universally, a race of mixed blood, but they possess a national
character which is quite distant from that of the neighbouring
tribes. The Semitic invasion may have taken place immediately after
the captivity of the Jews in Egypt or at an earlier or later date,
but it was powerful enough to affect the whole polity and
population of Ethiopia.</p>

<p>Generally, writers upon Abyssinia ascribe the incursion to the
reign of King Solomon, and this is in accordance with a legend that
is believed throughout the country. The Queen of Sheba was, of
course, the Queen of Ethiopia; her visit to the wise and
much-married king provided her with an heir; “her son Menelek was
in due time transmitted to his august sire. The young prince was
duly instructed in all the mysteries of Jewish law and science, and
being anointed king under the name of David, he was returned to his
native land, escorted by a large suite of the nobles of Israel, and
a band of her most learned elders under the direction of Ascarias,
the son of Zadok, the High Priest.</p>

<p>“The gates of the temple of Jerusalem were left unguarded, and
the doors miraculously opened in order that the holy ark of Zion
and the tables of the law might, without difficulty, be stolen and
carried away. The journey was prosperously performed, and the
Queen-Mother, on resigning the reins of authority to her son at her
death, about nine hundred and seventy years before the birth of
Christ, caused a solemn obligation to be sworn by all that
henceforth no female should hold sway in the land; and that those
princes of the blood royal upon whom the crown did not devolve
should, until the succession opened to them or during the natural
term of existence, be kept close prisoners on a lofty<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> mountain; a cruel and despotic
enactment which, through a long succession of ages, was jealously
observed.”<a id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class=
"fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>“The impetuous zeal of the emigrants,” wrote Mr. Stern, “found
ample scope for its loftiest inspiration in the new world to which
they were transplanted, and in the course of a few years the
worship of the God of Israel extensively supplanted the idolatries
of Ethiopia.</p>

<p>“From these vague traditions,” the same writer prudently added,
“in which truth and fiction are inextricably jumbled together, the
inquirer does not gain much trustworthy information on the history
of Ethiopia and the settlement of the Jews in that country.”<a id=
"FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class=
"fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Augustus Wylde visited a charming and sequestered spot
where, according to one legend, the stolen ark was deposited. “We
halted for lunch just <i>vis-à-vis</i> to the first sources of the
Taccazze. . . . Just before reaching the sources, on a hill on the
north side of the valley, is the church of Chevenan Gorgis, in a
splendid grove of juniper trees; immediately above the sources on
the hill is another church, also surrounded by juniper trees,
dedicated to Debbessa Jesu; tradition has it that when Menelek, the
son of the Queen of Sheba by King Solomon, came from Jerusalem with
the ark, it was placed on the ground at this spot, where he camped,
and these springs gushed forth, and he immediately ordered a temple
to be built on the spot.</p>

<p>“On leaving this camp Menelek commenced his march towards the
east, and on the bearers of the ark putting it down, after about an
hour’s march, they found that they could not move it, as it firmly
adhered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span> the
ground. This spot is supposed by some of the Abyssinians to be the
true resting-place of the ark that was brought from Jerusalem;
there is a church built over the spot called Eyela Kudus Michael. .
. . It is nearly impossible for a stranger to obtain admittance to
this church, and the place in the Holy of Holies where the ark is
supposed to rest is shown to no one. This ark cannot be in two
places; the people of the north declare it is in the sacred grove
of Axum in the church of Selata Musser (place of Moses), and the
priests of the Eyela district declare it is in their church, so
they always quarrel and wrangle over this vexed question, the same
as European priests do over their sacred relics.”<a id=
"FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class=
"fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the soundest opinion which can be formed under present
conditions as to the origin of the Abyssinian people has been
expressed by Mr. Wylde:—“The race, as the name Habash or Abyssinian
denotes, is a mixture, undoubtedly of very long standing, but most
likely of Jew with the inhabitants of Southern Arabia and the
non-negro races of Eastern Africa.”<a id=
"FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class=
"fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>According to tradition, Christianity was introduced into the
country in the fourth century.</p>

<p>“In the year 330 after the birth of our Saviour, Meropius, a
merchant of Tyre, having undertaken a commercial voyage to India,
landed on the coast of Ethiopia, where he was murdered by the
barbarians, and his two sons, Frumentius and Edesius, both devout
men, being made prisoners, were carried as slaves before the
Emperor. The abilities, the information, and the peaceable
demeanour of the brothers soon gained not only their release but
high office in the court; and living in the full confidence of the
monarch until his decease, and subsequently under the protection of
the Queen-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>mother,
the good-will of the entire nation quickly succeeded. The work of
conversion was commenced, and proceeding with wonderful rapidity
and success, a thriving branch was shortly added to the great
Eastern Church.</p>

<p>“Bearing the happy tidings, Frumentius appeared in Alexandria,
and was received with open arms by the Patriarch Athanasius. Loaded
with honours, and consecrated the first bishop of Ethiopia, a
relation was thus happily commenced with Egypt, which has remained
firm and friendly to the present day, and throughout fifteen
centuries has bestowed upon a Coptish priest the high office of
Patriarch Abouna (<i>i.e.</i> our Father) of the Ethiopic
Church.</p>

<p>“On his return to the country of his hopes, Frumentius found
that the spark of life had spread rapidly throughout the gloomy
darkness of the land. Baptism was instituted, deacons and
presbyters appointed, churches erected, and a firm foundation laid
whereon to establish the Christian religion in Abyssinia.</p>

<p>“During the succeeding century, priests and apostles, men of
wonderful sanctity, flocked into the Empire from all parts of the
East, and miracles the most stupendous are related in the legends
of those days. Mountains were removed, and the storms of the angry
ocean stilled by the mere application of the staff. The adder and
the basilisk glided harmless under foot, and rivers stayed their
roaring torrent, that the sandal of the holy man should remain
unstained by the flood. Aragáwi raised the dead—the fingers of
Likános flamed like tapers of fire—Samuel rode upon his lion; and
thus the kingdom of Arwé, the old serpent of Ethiop, was utterly
overthrown.”<a id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class=
"fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The conservatism of the Abyssinian people in matters<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span> of religion is well
illustrated by the fact that throughout the many and violent
vicissitudes of their history since the introduction of
Christianity they have always received their Patriarch from the
mother-church. His position is one of great authority. “The chief
man in the country after the king of kings is the Abouna, or
archbishop, the head of the Church; without the Abouna no king can
be crowned, and it is he that, at his own or the king’s wish, can
excommunicate any of his subjects, or the king himself, if
necessary, and then the king can only rule by the strength of his
followers who adhere to him. These archbishops come from the Coptic
Monastery at Alexandria or Cairo, and when they reach Abyssinia,
they never leave it on any consideration.”<a id=
"FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class=
"fnanchor">[128]</a> Moreover, “the Abyssinian Church, in common
with all other Christian communities in Asia and Africa, is
strictly episcopal. The Abouna, or primate, who is consecrated to
his office by the Patriarch of Alexandria, the revered successor of
St. Mark, can alone confer the priestly title. Every candidate,
before presenting himself for ordination, must have acquired some
knowledge in the reading of the sacred language of Ethiopia, and in
the complicated ceremonies of the liturgical service. On the day
appointed for ordination the primate, in full canonicals and seated
on the episcopal throne, receives the applicants for the sacred
office. All being properly ranged before the chair of St. Mark,
each candidate, instead of the imposition of hands, receives the
Abouna’s consecrating breath. Former archbishops, less scrupulous
than the present successor of Frumentius, indiscriminately breathed
on all, whether qualified or not, who could pay the requisite fee
of two salts—fourpence.<a id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“Deacons are
selected from among boys, who are only allowed to serve in the
Church till they attain the age of twelve or thirteen; after that
period their purity of life is suspected, and they are no longer
considered fit to approach the sacred shrine of the
<em>tabot</em>.<a id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130"
class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The bishop and monks may not marry,
while the priests may; and as, on the death of their wives, they
cannot contract a second alliance, the reverend wooers invariably
choose for their partners the most robust and sprightly lasses in
the land.</p>

<p>“The <em>debterahs</em>, or scribes, constitute the lowest but
the most influential body in the Church. These worthies enjoy no
ecclesiastical rank and are under no ecclesiastical discipline, and
yet no service can be properly performed unless they take part in
it. Their chief duty consists in chanting the Psalms and Liturgy,
but their uncouth gesticulation and discordant shouting, instead of
elevating devotion, tend rather, at least in European estimation,
to convert the service of God into a sinful burlesque and the
sanctuary into a bedlam. The scanty learning of the country is
exclusively monopolized by this order; and they are so proud of
their erudition that they deem it a disgrace to exchange, by the
breathing of the Abouna, the proud title of <em>debterah</em> for
the less learned appellation of <em>kas</em>, or priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“These literati,
notwithstanding their better acquaintance with the sacred volume
and the lives of the saints, are considered the most arrant
scoundrels in the land. Gondar, which contains a considerable
number of the fraternity, is notorious for the dissolute profligacy
of its inhabitants; and it is proverbial throughout the country
that wherever <em>debterahs</em> abound there vice and immorality
thrive.”<a id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class=
"fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Mansfield Parkyns found that many of the <em>debterahs</em>, or
<em>defterers</em>, professed to practise witchcraft. He wrote:
“There are persons in the country who are supposed to be able to
call up spirits and obtain from them any information they may
require. These men are mostly <em>defterers</em> (or Scribes), and
are regarded with a certain amount of rather dubious respect. The
scene of their incantation is generally some ravine, with a stream
running through it. As I have only heard the reports of the common
people on the subject, I cannot describe accurately what ceremonies
are observed, or what form the devil assumes on quitting the water
at their summons. My informants, however, assured me that he came
as a great chief, with the usual train of shield-bearers behind him
and gunners before him.”<a id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The Abyssinian liturgy is not impressive, according to European
ideas. Stern was present at one of the services, and gave a lively
description of it. “The deafening tom-tom of the <em>negareet</em>,
intermingled with the nasal chorus of a host of <em>debterahs</em>
in varying cadences, reverberated on my ear. This indication that
the service had already begun put a stop to our contemplation of
the grand mountain scene, and in a most reverent mood we hastened
to the uproarious sanctuary.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_225">[225]</span> A wooden gate in a circular wall brought us
within an open grassy space that formed the cemetery, and the spot
where, adjoining to the church, rises the Bethlehem in which the
priests prepare the eucharistic bread. A crowd of men and women, as
if in some place of amusement and dissipation, were spread in
picturesque knots over the soft turf. The majority were busily
plying their tongues, but I fear from the burst of merriment which
now and then broke from one or the other of those animated groups
that their conversations had very little to do either with religion
or the service in honour of the saint. Not belonging to this impure
class, who are justly excluded from the interior of the sacred
edifice (<i>i.e.</i> those whose marriage is secular and
dissoluble), we mounted a few steps, and then, through a partition
occupied by the laity, stepped into a second compartment concentric
with the outer one, and there found ourselves at the porch of the
enclosure which constitutes the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>.</p>

<p>“Crowds of priests and <em>debterahs</em> thronged the whole of
that corridor. The <em>debterahs</em> constitute the choir in all
their churches; and their devotionless mien, as they chanted to the
monotonous sound of the <em>negareet</em>, quite excited my
indignation. During the maddening noise created by the
<em>debterahs</em>, the priests, robed in gaudy canonicals, were
exerting to the utmost their cracked voices in intoning the liturgy
and psalms. At certain intervals an ecclesiastic, clad in his
garish finery, and attended by an incense-waving boy-deacon and a
bearer of the Ethiopic Gospel, marched out of his sanctum into the
cemetery to edify the godless and profane multitude by reading to
them a portion of Scripture in an unknown tongue. A reverend
gentleman near me, who was evidently a great Church dignitary, as
he wore a huge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
turban, and had a very stupid unmeaning face, pointed his gaunt
fingers towards the daubed walls, and condescendingly inquired
whether I knew St. George and Miriam, the mother of God? . . .</p>

<p>“Unable to perform any religious rite without the savage
accompaniment of tinkling keys and other discordant sounds, the
sacrament of the mass (<em>Corban</em>), the most solemn service of
the Church, is also performed amidst the most confused and
distracting clangour. The liturgy and consecration service over,
all, except the communicants, leave the place of worship. These now
approach the vestibule of the holy of holies, where the officiating
priests, enveloped in clouds of incense, are busily occupied in
washing their hands—this ceremony is copied from Pilate’s example.
The water, which this act sanctifies, must not be spilled on the
ground, but, as a regeneration emblem, it is sprinkled on the
bended heads and the garments of the faithful, whilst the priest
says, ‘If you think that I have now cleansed your garments and
purified your bodies, and yet continue to cherish hatred and malice
in your hearts, I tell you that the body of Christ will prove to be
a burning fire to consume you, and His blood a bottomless sea to
drown you!’ After this exhortation the <em>tabot</em>, the
substitute for the altar, is taken out of the holy of holies, and
each communicant receives a small piece of wheaten bread and a
spoonful of raisin wine. To prevent the desecration of the sacred
elements every one, before he quits the church, drinks a cup of
water, and also refrains from expectorating that day.”<a id=
"FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class=

<p>The ecclesiastical art of Abyssinia has already been mentioned.
Stern has given an account of a singular instance of its
development and of an equally strange<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_227">[227]</span> result of the devotional use of pictures.
He visited “Kudus Yohannes, which next to that at Quosquam, is the
handsomest and most gorgeously bedaubed of the forty-four churches
in and around Gondar.” Here “one aspiring artist, weary perhaps of
the antiquated cherubims and saints, the blazing flames and leafy
bowers, which are the ordinary ornaments of the churches, had
sought immortal fame by painting quite a new subject—the Migration
of the Israelites. In his picture he represented them marching in
soldier-like attitude over the heaving and surging waves of the Red
Sea, clad in British uniform, with muskets and bayonets on their
shoulders.” Again, Major Harris, at the time of his mission to
Sahela Selassie, who was then Negus, had presented His Majesty with
a portrait of Queen Victoria. This “lay securely guarded amidst the
regalia of the Ethiopian Empire till the death of the despot. His
heir and successor, Hailu Malakot, to atone for some indiscretion,
presented it in pious contrition to the Cathedral Church, and there
the people flock on all grand festivities to worship it as the
representation of the Virgin Mary.”<a id=
"FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class=
"fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Reference has been made to certain Abyssinian saints, to whose
exploits Major Harris alluded. But these are neither the most
notable nor the most venerated in the ecclesiastical chronicles.
Tekla Haimanot—<i>facile<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_228">[228]</span> princeps</i>—“is said to have converted the
devil, and induced him to become a monk for forty days, though what
became of him afterwards we are at a loss to know. The same holy
man, wishing to ascend a steep mountain with perpendicular sides
was accommodated in answer to prayer with a boa-constrictor, which
took him up on its back.”<a id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Before the birth of this
saint, “a glorious light rested for several days over the parental
house. At the baptism of the child the priest was so dazzled by its
supernatural beauty that, lost in admiration, he dropped the babe,
and might have killed it, had not an invisible hand kept it
suspended above the hard floor.” In due course Tekla Haimanot
became a monk, and “the mortifications, self-imposed penances and
incredibly long fasts which followed his initiation into the
monastic brotherhood are faithfully recorded in the annals of the
Church for the edification of the faithful.” Later, he visited the
Holy Sepulchre, after marvellous adventures among the Moslems, and
was subsequently ordained priest by the Copt Patriarch in Egypt. He
then proceeded to the Galla country, where his mother had been kept
prisoner, and converted the heathen by hundreds of thousands. On
one occasion he repaired to the monastery of Debra Damo, but here
“the brotherhood did not much sympathize in the general jubilee
that greeted the austere monk. The monastery stands on the summit
of a perpendicular rock, and, being quite inaccessible, no visitor
can reach it unless drawn up by a rope. The Evil One did not like
the ascetic to tamper with the merry fellows on the rock, and, to
effect his wicked purpose, he maliciously cut the frail support
when Tekla Haimanot was in mid-air, and probably he would have been
dashed to pieces in a ravine below, had not immediately six wings
unfurled themselves under<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_229">[229]</span> his garb and borne him aloft. In
commemoration of this miraculous volant power, the saint is
represented, in most of the churches dedicated to him, as nearly
smothered in a profusion of gorgeous plumage.”</p>

<p>Tekla Haimanot’s ascetic practices in “tenantless wastes and
malarious jungles” did not suffice him as the years advanced. “He
hit upon an original idea of mortifying the flesh. There is in Shoa
a small lake, which the saint in his peregrinations had often
passed. To these waters he now repaired. The good people who
followed him from all parts to hear his discourses and to obtain
his blessing entreated him not to expose his precious person to the
alligators and other aquatic monsters; but the holy man, who knew
that all his exploits for the glory of the Church had not yet been
accomplished, fearlessly stepped into the deep. Seven successive
years he continued in the water, and probably he would have expired
on his liquid couch, had not one of his legs dropped off. The
clamour for this valuable relic created quite a dissension in the
Church, but the monarch judiciously put a stop to the fierce war
between the rival claimants by ordering it to be kept as a
Palladium in the royal metropolis. This sacred talisman possesses
more wonderful sanitary virtues than all the drugs in the universe.
Patients from every province of the country visit the shrine to
make votive offerings and to quaff the healing water in which the
saint’s leg is weekly washed.”<a id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>That the miracles above related are stock miracles—if one may
use such a phrase—and that the same legends are connected with more
than one saint is evident from the following <i>gesta sanctorum</i>
cited by Mansfield Parkyns:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“Gabro Menfus
Kouddos (Slave of the Holy Ghost) was a great saint from his birth;
nay, more—he was born a saint. No sooner did he enter the world
than he stood up, and three days after his birth he bowed his head
thrice, saying in a distinct voice, ‘Glory be to the Father, and to
the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.’ He never tasted of his mother’s
milk, nor during the whole period of his life partook of food or
drink of any sort. Once, when praying on a mountain, he fell over a
precipice two hundred cubits deep. Two angels immediately joined
their spread wings under him to support him; but he refused their
assistance, saying that he trusted to God alone for help. Another
time he was ascending a very high mountain, and, being fatigued,
the Holy Trinity came and assisted him. Many other equally absurd
and almost blasphemous stories are related of him; at last, after a
very long life, I forget of how many years, the Almighty sent
Azrael, the angel of death, to take him. But the saint refused to
die, saying, that as he had neither eaten nor drunk, he could not
die. So all the saints came to him in turn for the purpose of
persuading him to leave earth for Paradise. St. John the Baptist
first addressed him, saying that he had gone the way of all flesh,
notwithstanding his many privations and sufferings. Gabro Menfus
Kouddos, however, at once met him with the answer, ‘Yes; but
<em>you</em> could not fast even for forty days, but fed on locusts
and wild honey.’ Thus he replied to all the saints, and at last
even to the Virgin and our Saviour. Still, however, the decrees of
the Omnipotent must be obeyed, and his life was taken from him; but
then there was a dispute among the elements as to what was to
become of his body. The earth refused to receive it, as he had
never partaken of her produce. A similar refusal was
made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span> by the water,
for he had never taken a drop within his lips. The fire had also
equally strong objections. So the saint was restored to life, and
taken up alive into heaven. His tomb is, however, shown at
Zoukwahla in Shoa; but it is said to contain only one of his ribs,
which, at the time of his ascent to heaven, he took out and left on
earth as a memento for his followers.</p>

<p>“Abouna Aragawy was one of the nine missionaries sent to
Abyssinia by St. Athanasius. His doctrine and the miracles which he
wrought gained for him many followers; but from some of the
unbelieving he suffered persecution. This is the account given by
some historians; while others assert that, overcome by his
popularity, he sought retirement from this world, in order to
devote the remainder of his days to religious duty. Be it as it
may, he came to the rock on which is now the celebrated monastery
of Debra Damo. After walking several times round it, without
finding any means of access to its summit, he prayed to the
Almighty, who sent him an enormous boa-constrictor, which offered
to carry him up in its mouth; but he said, ‘I fear your mouth; turn
round and let me take your tail.’ So the snake did as he was
desired; and the saint, holding fast by its tail, was drawn up to
the summit of the rock in perfect safety. The snake having
performed its duty offered to leave the saint if he wished it; but
Aragawy begged that it would remain, making, however, the condition
of its not alarming or destroying any of his disciples who might
come to visit him. They then took possession of the caves and holes
which are in the mountain, where they are by many supposed to be
still living. Some, however, pretend that the snake is dead; but no
one is so wanting in faith as for a moment to deny that the saint
yet lives there, and will continue<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_232">[232]</span> to live till the day of judgment. No
curious person, however, dares to venture into the cave. The monks
will not allow lights to be taken in; and the people assert that a
spirit which protects the place will not permit any one who enters
to come out alive.</p>

<p>“When I first went to Rohabaita it was reported that an immense
snake had some years before been killed there by a hunter. The man
was severely reproached by the priests, who said that the snake was
the guardian angel of the place. It was reported to have been
twenty-seven cubits, or forty feet in length, and was probably of
the boa tribe.”<a id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137"
class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Another saint of remarkable powers was Tederos (St. Theodore).
He resided at the hamlet near Rohabaita which now bears his name.
Here, “on the face of the rock is the little hole wherein he lived;
it is barely high enough for a person to squat in; and the marks
worn in the stone by the crown of his head, the soles of his feet,
and his elbows are still shown. His miracles were many. Among
others, a leopard ate up his son, the saint, returning home, missed
him, and set out in search of him. When in the forest he called
aloud to him three times, and at the third time the leopard
appeared: on seeing him, the saint guessed how the matter stood
with the unfortunate youth; but, nothing discouraged, he coolly
ordered the beast to return him safe and sound. Now this was rather
difficult, as the leopard had, no doubt, half digested him;
nevertheless, so great was the saint’s power that the boy left the
leopard’s maw none the worse, perhaps rather the better, for having
been dismembered and reconstructed. Being asked where a church
should be built, the saint threw his staff, desiring the inquirers
to build where they found the staff had<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_233">[233]</span> fallen. After many days it was found
several miles off in Serawi, on the other side of the valley,
exactly on the spot where now stands the church of Debra
Mariam.</p>

<p>“Many other wonderful stories were told me of his feats, but I
have forgotten them. The most useful act attributed to him was that
he caused the rock below him to become hollow, in order to receive
the rain-water. The hollow still exists, though I should strongly
suspect it to be of Nature’s construction; or, if the saint had a
hand in its design, he must have been a clumsy fellow, for with
half the labour he might have made a place capable of containing
twice the quantity of water.”<a id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Parkyns was not sure of the parentage of the youth who was
disgorged by the leopard. “I hope I am right in giving St. Theodore
a son,” he wrote. “I don’t know whether his being a father would
preclude his being a saint: however, it was a youth nearly related
to him, if I remember the story right.”</p>

<p>Some chroniclers “pretend that St. Matthew and St. Bartholomew
actually visited the country. Some even go so far as to assert that
the Virgin Mary herself, with the child Jesus, came into Abyssinia
when she fled to Egypt, and show a place in a high mountain which
is called her throne or seat.”<a id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Bruce wrote that “in the
Synaxar, or history of their saints, one is said to have thrown the
devil over a high mountain; another persuaded him to live as a monk
for forty years; another had a holy longing for partridges, upon
which a brace perched on his plate—martyrs ready roasted.”<a id=
"FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class=
"fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>“In many cases,” Parkyns wrote, “the patron saint<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span> is preferred to the Almighty;
and a man who would not hesitate to invoke the name of his Maker in
witness to a falsehood would have difficulty in disguising his
perjury if he were appealed to in the name of St. Michael or St.
George. It is also a well-known fact, and most common of
occurrence, that a favour besought in the name of God would often
be refused, while, if the request were immediately after repeated
in the name of the Virgin or of some favourite saint, it would
probably be granted. This may be observed in the appeal of the
common street beggar in Tigre, whose ordinary cry is, ‘Silla
Izgyheyr! Silla Medhainy Allam!’ (For the sake of God! For the sake
of the Saviour!)—while, if he be very importunate, he will change
his usual whining tone, and add with persuasive emphasis, ‘Silla
Mariam! Silla Abouna Tekla Haimanout!’” (For the sake of Mary! For
the sake of Tekla Haimanout!)</p>

<p>It has already been said that Tekla Haimanot and other early
celebrities of the Church were monks. Monasteries are plentiful in
the land, and there are also hermits who practise asceticism in
desolate and lonely places. Mr. Herbert Vivian gained admission to
a conventual house, and has given a lively description of it.<a id=
"FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class=
"fnanchor">[141]</a> The sanctity of the Abyssinian monk or
anchorite is in proportion to his prowess in mortifying the flesh,
and this class of men still retains much religious
<em>prestige</em> and influence in the land. But probably the
pristine rigour of their life has been much relaxed, and the
remarks of Major Cornwallis Harris are applicable at the present
time.</p>

<p>“Education was in former days to be obtained alone from the
inmate of the monastic abode, and a life of scanty food, austerity,
and severe fasting was embraced<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_235">[235]</span> only by the more enthusiastic. But the
skin-cloak and the dirty headdress now envelope the listless monk,
who, satisfied with a dreamy and indolent existence, basks during
the day on the grassy banks of the sparkling rivulet, and prefers a
bare sufficiency of coarse fare to the sweeter morsel earned by the
sweat of the brow.”<a id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142"
class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The same writer’s account of the consecration of a friar is
interesting. “The monk is admitted to the order of his choice by
any officiating priest. A prayer is repeated, the skull-cap blessed
with the sign of the cross, and the ceremony is complete. But a
more imposing rite attends the oath of celibacy before the Abouna.
The clergy assemble in numbers, and fires are lighted around the
person of the candidate. His loins are bound about with the
leathern girdle of Saint John, and the prayer and the requiem for
the dead rise pealing from the circle. The <em>glaswa</em>—a narrow
strip of black cloth adorned with coloured crosses—is then placed
on the shaven crown, and shrouded from view by the enveloping
shawl; and the archbishop, clad in his robes of state, having
repeated the concluding prayer and blessing, signs with his own
hand the emblem of faith over the various parts of the body.”<a id=
"FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class=
"fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Consul Plowden wrote in a somewhat censorious mood of the
Abyssinian regulars. “Monasteries are not wanting to complete the
resemblance to the Roman Catholic Church and to the Middle Ages,
where every immorality is practised; nor solitary hermits, who
dwell in gloomy forests, feeding on roots, and exposed to ferocious
animals, and who are sometimes as sincere as they are useless.” He
added, “nunneries alone are absent from the picture; though vows of
celibacy are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
sometimes taken, if rarely kept save at an advanced age.”</p>

<p>With regard to religious sisterhoods he was in error. Bruce
wrote that, “all women who choose to renounce acquaintance with men
are allowed to turn priests, they then wear a skull-cap, like the
men; and these priests, male and female, all pretend to possess
charms of a nature both offensive and defensive, which are most
generally believed in.”<a id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The same writer asserted
that he and his party on one occasion, after passing the River
Taccazze, “at last reached a plain filled with flowering shrubs,
roses, jessamines, etc., and animated by a number of people passing
to and fro. Several of these were monks and nuns from Waldubba, in
pairs, two and two together. The women, who are both young and
stout, were carrying large burdens of provisions on their
shoulders, which showed that they did not entirely subsist upon the
herbs of Waldubba. The monks, their <i>compagnons de voyage</i>,
had sallow faces, yellow cowls, and yellow gowns.”<a id=
"FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class=
"fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Bruce may have been mistaken as to the character of these young
women; but not all who take the vows are strict in the observance
of them. Mr. Augustus Wylde met a nun in the flesh, a lady of high
rank in the country, whose charms were neither “offensive nor
defensive.” He wrote, “before getting to Mokareet we were joined by
Ras Mangesha’s young sister. She is supposed to be a nun and devote
her time to charity and good actions, and she has asked permission
of Hailou to join us and camp with us for the next three or four
days. I now quote from my diary—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“I believe this
is a got-up job, as Hailou had his hair replaited this morning and
put on clean cloths, and the pair are evidently very old friends.
She is dressed in the most spotless white garments of the very best
quality, and is most clean and neat in her appearance. From under
her clean white hood a pretty face appears with a pair of roguish
merry eyes. . . . She sent over her pretty waiting-maid as soon as
camp was pitched, asking me to come and pay her a visit, but I was
too seedy with fever, so sent Schimper to make my excuses; when he
came back his first remark in his precise manner of talking was:
‘Oh, Mr. Wylde, I do not think she is a very good lady, she has
asked me for many things, and she wants your umbrella.’ Of course I
had to send it, and next morning on the way to Merta I had some of
the sweetest of smiles, and we kept up a long conversation; she had
never seen an Englishman before, and she wanted to know if they all
had red heads and moustaches and were big men . . .</p>

<p>“I found out that she was considered very ‘rapid’ even for
Abyssinia, where the young ladies are fast, and that her brother
had sent her to a nunnery as he could not keep her in order, and
she absolutely refused to marry the men of his choice; she was
changing her quarters from one nunnery to another, and was
evidently sweet on Hailou.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Wylde had met other nuns, “good pious old ladies at
Abbi-Addi and Macalle, who fasted for over half the number of days
in the year, and were perpetually praying and singing from the
early grey dawn till late at night, and they seemed to live a calm
and peaceful life in their beautiful natural surroundings, and
bothered themselves very little with the troubles of this life, and
passed their days in eating, sleeping, and praying, and doing what
little acts of charity they could in the way<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_238">[238]</span> of tending the sick and feeding any poor
beggars that came to their houses.”<a id=
"FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class=
"fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Many rites and ceremonies of Hebrew origin have been
incorporated in Abyssinian Christianity, <i>e.g.</i> circumcision
is practised. Considering the history and traditions of the people,
this respect for Judaic ordinances is not surprising. Major Harris
devoted a chapter of his book to “Abyssinian Rites and Practices
which would appear to have been borrowed from the Hebrews,” and
most of the authors who have written about the country have alluded
to the same subject. Perhaps the most remarkable example of the
influence of Jewish doctrines is the veneration in which the
<em>tabot</em> is held.</p>

<p>“The Jewish temple consisted of three distinct divisions—the
forecourt, the holy, and the holy of holies. To the first laymen
were admitted, to the second only the priest, and to the third the
high priest alone. All entrance was denied to the Pagan, a custom
which is rigorously enforced in Abyssinia; and her churches are in
like manner divided into three parts.</p>

<p>“Eight feet in breadth, the first compartment stretches, after
the fashion of a corridor, entirely around the building. It is
styled <em>Kene Máhelet</em>, and, strewed throughout with green
rushes, forms the scene of morning worship. To the right of the
entrance is the seat of honour for priests and erudite scribes; and
beyond this court, save on certain occasions, the bare foot of the
unlearned layman cannot pass.</p>

<p>“<em>Makdas</em> is the second compartment. This is the
sanctuary in which the priests officiate, and a corner is set apart
for laymen during the administration of the holy supper, whilst a
cloth screens the mysteries of the interior. Here also hang,
arranged around the walls,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_239">[239]</span> the bones of many deceased worthies, which
have been carefully gathered from the newly opened sepulchre, and
are deposited by the hand of the priest in cotton bags. By the
nearest relative the first opportunity is embraced of transporting
these mouldering emblems of mortality to the sacred resting-place
of Debra Libanos, where the living and the dead are alike blessed
with a rich treasure of righteousness, since the remains of Tekla
Haimanot, the patron saint of Abyssinia, still shed a bright halo
over the scene of his miracles upon earth.</p>

<p>“To <em>Kedis Kedisen</em>, the holy of holies, none but the
Alaka<a id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class=
"fnanchor">[147]</a> is admitted. Behind its veil the sacrament is
consecrated, the communion vessels are deposited, and the
tremendous mysteries of the <em>tabot</em>, or ark of the covenant,
are shrouded from the eyes of the uninitiated. The gold of the
foreigner has penetrated the secret of the contents of this box,
which are nothing more than a scroll of parchment, on which is
inscribed the name of the patron saint of the church; but the
priest who dared to open his lips on the subject to one of his own
countrymen would incur the heavy penalties due to the
sacrilege.”<a id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class=
"fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Another foreigner whose gold “penetrated the secret” of the
<em>Kedis Kedisen</em> was Mr. Herbert Vivian. In company with a
friend he was, for a consideration of two dollars, admitted to the
<i>sanctum sanctorum</i> of the Church of St. Raguel at Entotto.
“The custodians seemed to know very well that they were doing
wrong, and displayed huge anxiety to get the thing over as quickly
as possible. They hurried us up the rickety steps, opened the door
of the sanctuary, took great care to keep us as<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span> far off as possible, and kept
exclaiming, ‘Now that is all. I hope you are satisfied. Let us go
away again. You ought really to give us some more dollars for what
we have done.’ There was, however, really next to nothing to see.
In the darkness I could just make out the tabernacle inside the
holy of holies. It was a kind of ark, covered with cheap draperies
and surmounted by a crucifix. A few lanterns lay about. That was
all. At any rate, that was all that we could induce the priest to
show us.”<a id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class=
"fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Hormuzd Rassam has given a sketch of a <em>tabot</em> in his
book, with the following description: “The <em>tabot</em> is a
square block of wood on which the emblem of the cross, with some
appropriate passage of Scripture, is sometimes represented. No
church can be consecrated without it, and in the church from which
it has been removed the Lord’s Supper cannot be celebrated. It is
placed upon the altar in the centre of the holy of holies, and by
the ignorant clergy is regarded with as much veneration as the
consecrated elements.”<a id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Annually, on the eve of
the festival which commemorates Christ’s baptism, the
<em>tabot</em> is carried out of the church by the chief
officiating priest, “and left all night covered in a tent or hut
erected for the purpose near a stream or pool. At daybreak the
following morning it is taken to the water, and after being
sprinkled with a few drops is again enveloped in the church-cloth,
and replaced under the tent until the time arrives for its formal
restoration to the church—a grand religious ceremony, accompanied
with singing of psalms and dancing.” In this recessional solemnity,
which Mr. Rassam saw, “the priests led the way, bearing various
sacred symbols, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
chanting psalms all the while, followed by a train of about three
hundred men and a score of damsels, all dancing, singing, and
screeching as they went.”<a id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The appearance of Abyssinian churches has already been alluded
to, but the following general description, given by Major Harris,
may serve to bring the principles of their construction clearly
before the reader. “There are, perhaps, more churches in Abyssinia
than in any other part of the Christian world; and he who has
erected one believes that he has atoned for every sin. But even the
best are very miserable edifices of wattle plastered with mud, only
to be distinguished from the surrounding hovels by a thin coating
of whitewash, which is dashed over the outside to point with the
finger of pride to the peculiar privilege of the two great powers
in the land. Circular in form, with a door to each quarter of the
compass, and a conical thatch, they have an apex surmounted by a
brazen cross, which is usually adorned with ostrich eggs; and the
same depraved and heathenish taste pervades the decorations of the
interior. Sculpture is strictly forbidden; but the walls are
bedaubed with paintings of the patron saint of the church, the
Blessed Virgin, and a truly incongruous assemblage of cherubim and
fallen angels, with the evil one himself enveloped in hell flames.
Timbrels and crutches depend in picturesque confusion from the bare
rafters of the roof, and no ceiling protects the head from the
descent of the lizard and the spider.”<a id=
"FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class=
"fnanchor">[152]</a> Mr. Hormuzd Rassam has given a sketch of the
ground plan of an Abyssinian church, showing the entrances and
“courts.”<a id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class=
"fnanchor">[153]</a> According<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_242">[242]</span> to him “the outer enclosure is for the
congregation generally, male and female, the former occupying the
western portion, and praying with their faces towards the east; the
latter standing opposite to them and facing the west.”<a id=
"FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class=
"fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The “crutches” mentioned by Major Harris astonished Mr. Vivian
at a later date. He saw them in a monastery, and “imagined they had
been contributed by lame people, to whom the saint of the place had
restored the use of their legs. As a matter of fact, however, they
were merely the crutches which every priest uses in the ritual of
the dance.”<a id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class=
"fnanchor">[155]</a> The manner in which these singular adjuncts of
the priestly office are employed has been described by Mr. Vivian.
He attended a service at Trinity Church in Addis Abiba, and has
given a very interesting account of the ceremonies. At a certain
stage “all the priests grasp their long crutches and go through a
kind of gymnastic exercise, which reminds me of the use of spears
at a Somali dance. The crutches are five feet long, and must, I
imagine, have originally taken their origin from spears, adapted
for civilian use. The tops are either of ivory or brass, some of
them elaborately carved. . . . One priest acts as conductor, and
the others imitate his movements, all singing loudly through their
noses. . . . The crutches are held in the middle and darted at the
ground, now near, now far, with a forward movement made by slightly
bending the right knee. It is as though spears were being poised
and aimed playfully at objects on the floor. The crutches are then
lifted, crook end up, a foot into the air, they are poised, they
are swung, with ever-increasing vigour. All of a<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> sudden the whole exercise
ceases without any warning whatever.”<a id=
"FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class=
"fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Major Harris wrote, with regard to certain other clerical
functions—“The Father Confessor is bound to the strictest secrecy;
and it is believed that on this point a dread oath is taken before
ordination, when all the mysteries are expounded by the Abouna, and
especially those which have reference to the preparation of bread
for the holy supper. In a small house styled Bethlehem,<a id=
"FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class=
"fnanchor">[157]</a> which rises immediately behind every church,
the mysterious ceremony is performed. The deacon can alone bake the
cake; and the most vigilant guard is invariably preserved against
the approach or intrusion of females or other improper visitors
during the hour of solemn preparation.”<a id=
"FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class=
"fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The second appendix of the same volume contains a summary of the
“Senkesar, or Synaxaria, being a <i>Collectio Vitarum Sanctarum</i>
together with the Calendar of the Ethiopic Christian Church.” The
compiler of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> the
summary wrote, “The following calendar, translated from the Latin
of Ludolf, has been considerably enlarged by a comparison at
Ankóber with a complete copy of the ‘Senkesar.’ The lives of the
Saints, or the detail of miracles written against each day, are
publicly read in the churches at the services beginning at the
cock’s first crowing.”</p>

<p>The first month of the Abyssinian year is September. It is not
surprising that in the long list of saints, patriarchs, prophets,
martyrs, virgins, hermits, kings, “Fathers,” presbyters, emperors,
and male and female ascetics whose deeds are commemorated between
New Year’s Day (September 1, by Ethiopian reckoning) and the
festival of St. Andrew and Moses, Bishop of Ferme, (being the
thirtieth and last day of August according to the same
computation), there should occur many names of worthies who are
unknown to most European readers. For instance—</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Abba Anbasa, who rode upon a lion.</li>

<li>Eustathius, who brought a dead child back to life. (This
miracle is attributed to many of the saints.)</li>

<li>Ananias, who baptized St. Paul.</li>

<li>Pantaleon.</li>

<li>Jemrah, a martyr. On the spot where his blood was spilt there
grew up a fine vine.</li>

<li>Naakweto-Laab, the last Emperor of Ethiopia, of the family of
Zague. He did not die.</li>

<li>Cosmus, Metropolite. It is said that the image of Mary shed
tears when it beheld his excruciating tortures.</li>

<li>The two hundred and ninety-two brothers and forty-nine sisters
of Cosmus.</li>

<li>Abba Marina, who was discovered after death to have been a
woman.</li>

<li>Barsufius.</li>

<li>Johannes Cama, whose fingers and nails seemed burning like
candles during prayer.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>Abba Libanus,
who brought water out of a rock.</li>

<li>Daniel, the woman-hater, who vowed never to look at a
woman.</li>

<li>The forty-nine old hermits.</li>

<li>Joseph, who was saved out of a fiery oven.</li>

<li>The 80,107 martyrs with Isidorus.</li>

<li>Atom and Arianus.</li>

<li>Eusebius, who, “being threatened to be burnt, was taken to
heaven by Uriel the archangel, and remained there fourteen
years.”<a id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class=
"fnanchor">[159]</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="nind">And many others whose sanctity is as little known
in the Western Churches.</p>

<p>If there is anywhere a leisured and adventurous student of
comparative hagiology, he would obtain some interesting results by
tracing the origin and growth of the legends which glorify these
worthies.</p>

<p>A survey of what has been said shows that Consul Plowden was
fully justified when he wrote, “the Christianity professed and
taught in Abyssinia is much materialized.” Nevertheless, the
credulity and superstition which prevail in the country are not in
essence grosser than the unwarranted beliefs which were accepted in
Europe when the <i>Aurea Legenda</i> passed as sound devotional
reading, and it would be as unjustifiable to judge the intellectual
capability of the Habashes by their faith in myths as it would have
been to estimate the ability of our forefathers by a similar
standard. Nor is it certain that any sudden reformation would
improve the religious state of the people. An intemperate zeal for
enlightening them might, by introducing an ideal far above their
real sympathies and comprehension, discredit the old conceptions
without effectually substituting<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_247">[247]</span> the new. Moreover, the fabulous feats of
the saints may require a cautious and sparing criticism; for to
differentiate the degrees of probability in miracles, among an
unscientific but argumentative race, would, perhaps, be more likely
to promote scepticism as to all thaumaturgy than to lead to the
repudiation of certain miracles and the continued acceptance of
others.</p>

<p>It is, of course, the fact that at present “religion” consists
of little more than a mere series of outward observances.
Veneration of the fabric of the church takes the place of devotion
within its precincts. Dufton wrote:—“The prayers are read in
Ethiopic” (Geez), “a language which the people know nothing about,
so that little profit can be derived from the service. Indeed, most
persons content themselves with kissing the floor or the walls of
the edifice, and such is a criterion of a man’s piety; he kisses
the church, they say, and so esteem him a good Christian. Some will
utter a prayer. The petition takes a form similar to the following,
which an old woman was heard to offer up during my visit, though
the last clause is probably in most cases omitted—</p>

<p>“‘O Lord, give me plenty to eat and drink, good raiment, and a
comfortable home, or else kill me outright!’”</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian visited the Church of the Blessed Virgin at Entotto,
and noticed that all the Abyssinians who were with him “hastened to
kiss the floor-beam and side-posts or lintels of the door in the
outer wall.” And at Trinity Church in Addis Abiba “whenever a
peasant approached the church on a mule, he dismounted and kissed a
large black stone which stood some twenty yards away. Other persons
of a more pious turn of mind went right up to the entrance and
kissed not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span> the
lintels, but even the floor-beam of the doorway. This was also done
by everybody who was coming to church, and my servant, in whom I
had never detected any semblance of piety on the road, was
particularly punctilious in this respect.”<a id=
"FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class=
"fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>But it is not the case that the Habashes avoid all religious
duties that are irksome. Parkyns wrote: “Their fasts are more
numerous perhaps than those of any other Christian people, more
than two-thirds of the year being assigned to abstinence. Nor in
their fasting do they get off as easily as Roman Catholics; for it
is not sufficient that they should abstain from animal food only;
an Abyssinian, during fast-time, neither eats nor drinks anything
till late in the afternoon. . . . It is true the Mohammedans do
nearly the same during their month of Ramadan; but they only change
the day into night, feasting during the night-time on more
luxurious food than many of them could allow themselves during the
remainder of the year; while the Abyssinian, when he does eat,
confines himself to dried peas, dressed in a sort of bad oil, or to
an equally unpalatable dish made of a kind of spinach, called
‘hamly’ or ‘goummen.’ . . . Many of the Abyssinian fasts are of
long duration. The time of day when the people may eat is
determined by the length of a man’s shadow, measured by his own
feet, and varies in different fasts. Thus the fast of Advent is
during the last ten days of the month Hedar (October) and the whole
of Tahsas (November), and during each day till a man’s shadow
measures nine and a half feet. The fast of Lent lasts till sunset
during fifty-five days. . . . Besides these are the Wednesdays and
Fridays, making nearly 260 days of fasting. . . . Some of the
priests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span> are very
rigorous in keeping all these fasts, and many even voluntarily add
a number for their own observance. The people, too, in general are
tolerably attentive to this duty; and I have frequently met with
men undergoing extreme labour, yet persevering in what they have
been brought up to consider as one of the most essential parts of
their religion; for, strictly speaking, a man who has been known to
neglect the rules of the Church is looked upon almost as an
infidel, and should he die in such a state of disobedience, his
body would be refused sepulture in the churches. Good Friday and
the following day are passed by the priests and the rigidly devout
in an absolute fast of forty-eight hours.”<a id=
"FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class=
"fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Plowden remarked: “So much do they attach importance to this
(fasting) and other outward forms that a man of Hamazayn<a id=
"FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class=
"fnanchor">[162]</a> will slay his near relative, and returning
home calmly, will be horror-stricken should his wife have ground
flour on a saint’s day, or prepared his meal before the hours of
fasting have expired.”<a id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>It must be owned that the Habashes recompense themselves as far
as possible for the severity of their abstinence by gluttony at the
numerous feasts which the Church also ordains.</p>

<p>Major Cornwallis Harris drew attention to a singular custom in
the following words—“Fasts, penances, and excommunication form the
chief props of the clerical power; but the repentant sinner can
always purchase a substitute to undergo the two former, and the ban
of the Church is readily averted by a timely offering.”<a id=
"FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class=
"fnanchor">[164]</a> This seems to indicate an opinion among the
Abyssinians that a sin is expiated not by the contrition of the
evil-doer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span> but by a
formal amount of punishment undergone somewhere by some one—no
matter by whom.</p>

<p>The Abyssinian Church teaches, and the great majority of the
people accept, the doctrine of transubstantiation. Those who hold
this belief “assert that the actual body and blood of our Saviour
are partaken of by the faithful, but that an angel takes them away
from an unbeliever, and restores the bread and wine, in his hands,
in their natural state, such as they were previous to the
benediction. The wine is merely an infusion of dried
raisins.”<a id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class=
"fnanchor">[165]</a> Stern tells the story of a miracle which is
supposed to have established the fact of transubstantiation, and
adds, “The erudite reject the legend, and, in their sentiments,
approximate to the Lutheran doctrine of consubstantiation.”<a id=
"FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class=
"fnanchor">[166]</a> The Church also teaches the doctrine of
purgatory and that “prayers for the dead are necessary, and
absolution indispensable. The souls of the departed do not
immediately enter upon a state of happiness, the period being in
exact accordance with the alms and prayers that are expended upon
earth.”<a id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class=
"fnanchor">[167]</a> Stern declared that “the number of masses
requisite for the repose of the soul has not been defined by the
Church, and thus the misery or bliss of the defunct is at the mercy
of niggardly relatives and exacting priests.”<a id=
"FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class=
"fnanchor">[168]</a> Both writers attribute the introduction of
this opinion to the Jews.</p>

<p>The badge of Ethiopian Christianity, worn by all classes, is the
<em>mateb</em>, a blue neck-thread of silk or wool. This is the
distinctive mark of the Abyssinians’ creed; they hardly believe
that one who does not wear it is in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_251">[251]</span> reality a Christian, and, said Dufton,
besides disdaining their Mohammedan and Jewish neighbours, “they
often include in their contempt every form of Christianity even
which does not conform to their own”<a id=
"FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class=
"fnanchor">[169]</a>—in which prejudice they are not so singular as
at a first glance they may appear to be. Commonly a silver ring or
cross is attached to the cord.</p>

<p>The general character of the clergy appears from what has
already been related. Parkyns saw them in remote places and in
their least spiritual aspect. For instance, in describing the feast
on St. Michael’s day at Addy Harisho, he wrote: “An old priest came
up to me and offered, on the part of himself and his brethren, to
perform, if I pleased, the religious dance and song used by them on
such occasions. I never shall forget their ludicrous efforts to
appear graceful, at the same time staggering every step; while the
expression of devotion they affected to assume was reduced to a
languid smile and thickening eyelids, expressive of nothing but
liquor. A hiccup or two occasionally interfered with the solemn
words they were chanting; and the stately movements they had begun
with changed gradually, and by degrees the dance became a reel, or
rather reeling movement, the words only which accompanied it
remaining solemn. At last an old priest, suddenly forgetting the
original chant, changed its words to those of a jovial drinking
ditty: ‘Don’t you stop the liquor, and I will dance for ever!’
Instead of the marks of disapprobation from his fellow-priests,
they only burst into a loud laugh, and, declaring the entertainment
to be changed for the better, all with one consent followed his
example and his tune.”<a id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>Nevertheless,
Parkyns wrote of the priests with tolerance and good humour. And it
is worthy of note that two other British writers who knew the
country well have had a good word to say for the clergy. Plowden,
after mentioning some of their faults, observed: “It is just to say
that they have preserved the Christian faith, impure indeed, but
still alive, in the midst of foreign invasion, domestic
degradation, and the extinction of Government, and that it is under
their protection that agriculture flourishes, and villages are
built where deserts would else be seen.”<a id=
"FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class=
"fnanchor">[171]</a> Mr. Augustus Wylde, among several remarks in a
similar sense, said: “I have found the clergy, if left alone,
peaceable, simple-minded men, very hospitable and always willing to
do me a good turn, and ready to help me and pass me on to their
neighbouring friends, and I expect other travellers would find them
the same as long as they treated them properly.”<a id=
"FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class=
"fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>An interesting instance of the survival of a Jewish institution
among the Christians of Abyssinia is that of Cities of Refuge.
Plowden wrote, “All the larger towns are entirely under their (the
priests’) control, and being cities of refuge, sacred even from the
Ras, are filled with dissolute and dangerous characters.”<a id=
"FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class=
"fnanchor">[173]</a> Parkyns mentioned Axum as a place of this
kind, and added, “at Adoua the whole of that part called after the
church, in fact the parish, is sanctuary (‘guddam’), and no person
having taken refuge there can be arrested, although he walk about
the public streets in broad daylight, so long as he does not pass
the parish boundaries.”<a id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Stern alluded to the
subject, and had formed the impression that churches in general
were sanctuaries. “In most cases the murderer may elude the violent
rage of his pursuers<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_253">[253]</span> by taking refuge in a church, where the
priests will negotiate the price of his release.”<a id=
"FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class=
"fnanchor">[175]</a> He mentioned also certain rivers—the Taccazze
and the Abai—forming the limits of provinces, which the “avenger of
blood” may not pass.<a id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The Jewish Sabbath is still held in veneration by the Abyssinian
Christians. Parkyns observed that a feast called “adam Souaur,” or
“left Saturday,” was observed, “as that day was formerly the Jewish
Sabbath, but given up by the Christians for the Sunday at the time
of the resurrection of our Saviour. The priests collect a quantity
of rushes, and bless them in the church; and then a priest and a
deacon take them out into the parish, the deacon carrying the
bundle, and the priest distributing the rushes to all passers-by,
binding them on the head of the receiver. They also visit the
houses with them, and generally receive a handsome present.”<a id=
"FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class=
"fnanchor">[177]</a> It would be interesting to discover the origin
of this custom. Major Harris, writing in 1843, said, “The Jewish
Sabbath is strictly observed throughout the kingdom. The ox and ass
are at rest. Agricultural pursuits are suspended. Household
avocations must be laid aside, and the spirit of idleness reigns
throughout the day.”<a id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The same writer has
given a brief history of the observance.<a id=
"FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class=
"fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>It is well known that at one time Abyssinia was, so far as the
Emperor’s power extended at that period, converted to Roman
Catholicism by the instrumentality of Portuguese missionaries. The
connection with Portugal commenced in 1499, when Pedro Covilham
penetrated by way of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, to
Shoa,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> where the
Emperor then held his court. He was well received. An ancient
Ethiopian law decreed that no foreigner who reached Abyssinia
should be allowed to leave the country, but Covilham was permitted
to send home an account of his experiences. At a later date a
further communication from the traveller induced the Portuguese
Government to despatch an embassy, which, after many privations and
adventures, arrived in Shoa in October, 1520. It brought no
presents, and was not cordially welcomed. However, the Emperor
desired to send an answer to the King of Portugal, and therefore—in
defiance of the ancient usage—allowed the ambassador to return to
Lisbon, taking with him an Ethiopian envoy. But certain of the
Portuguese were detained in Abyssinia, among whom was a priest
named John Bermudez.</p>

<p>Some years later this man was appointed Abouna, or Patriarch, on
the death of the incumbent of that office. He made his way to Rome,
where Pope Paul III. confirmed his title, and he thence proceeded,
in accordance with the Emperor’s desire, to Portugal, and solicited
the aid of European troops to assist the Abyssinians in repelling
the Mohammedan invasion which then threatened the country.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Government despatched an expedition of some four
hundred men under Don Christopher de Gama. These troops disembarked
at Massowah in 1542. In an engagement with the Mohammedan forces on
August 30 of that year the Abyssinian allies took to flight, and
the Portuguese were surrounded. They cut their way through the
enemy and effected their retreat, but Don Christopher, who had been
wounded, was captured by the enemy and murdered by the Mohammedan
commander. His skull was sent to Constantinople as a<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span> trophy. The surviving
Portuguese besought of the Emperor an opportunity to avenge their
leader, and they shortly afterwards took part in an action in which
the Mohammedan forces were routed with great slaughter.</p>

<p>These circumstances added to the influence of Bermudez, but he
insisted rigorously on the complete acceptance of Roman doctrine
and ritual by the Abyssinians, and thus incurred the resentment of
the Emperor. As a consequence he lost the advantages which he and
his compatriots had gained, and finally abandoned his task and
quitted the country, embarking at Massowah, where he had
landed.</p>

<p>A subsequent mission under the leadership of Oviedo, Bishop of
Hieropolis, which reached Massowah in 1558, failed equally, after
many adventures—including an Abyssinian Council at which the
Emperor and the bishop publicly and heatedly disputed about points
of doctrine—and in 1560 Oviedo received orders from Rome to
withdraw from Ethiopia and proceed to Japan.</p>

<p>Peter Paez was the next missionary who attempted to bring
Abyssinia into communion with the Catholic Church. After suffering
shipwreck in the Red Sea and enduring a seven years’ captivity in
the hands of the Turks he landed at Massowah in 1600. Paez was a
man of prudence and ability. He prepared himself for his task by
learning the Geez language and opening a school at Maiguagua, in
which he was able to study the character of the Abyssinian people.
He acquired a reputation as a teacher and disputant, and in 1604
was summoned to the court, where the reigning Emperor, Za Dengel,
received him as a person of distinction. He soon acquired influence
over this monarch, who sanctioned the use of the Roman ritual and
shortly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span> became a
convert to Catholicism. A rebellion—one of the ordinary incidents
of Abyssinian politics—was organized against him, and he was slain.
A period of civil war ensued, during which his successor shared the
same fate.</p>

<p>The crown then passed to the Emperor Segued (called also
Socinios and Susneus).<a id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Paez aroused his
interest by his skill in architecture and his other talents, was
received into favour, and for the second time induced the ruler of
the country to recognize the authority of the Catholic Church.
Letters announcing the event, signed by the Emperor himself, were
sent to the Pope and the King of Portugal. Paez died in 1623,
shortly after receiving Segued’s formal abjuration of heresy and
administering to him the sacrament of penance.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of the Emperor’s letter, the Pope, in 1624,
despatched to Ethiopia a mission headed by Alphonso Mendez, a
Jesuit and doctor of divinity. This envoy and his followers reached
Abyssinia in 1625. On February 11, 1626, before the court and the
magnates of the country, the Emperor avowed his submission to the
head of the Catholic Church, and took the oath of obedience to the
Holy See. A proclamation was then made that “all persons intended
for priests should embrace the Catholic religion under pain of
death, and that all should follow the forms of the Church of Rome
in the celebration of Easter and Lent under the same penalty.”</p>

<p>The change of creed was not popular in the country. It was
opposed by force, and became the occasion of a renewal of civil
war. The Emperor found that he had alienated his subjects, and, in
spite of the protests and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_257">[257]</span> resistance of Mendez, he issued, in 1632,
an edict by which he restored the ancient religion to its former
authority, and abdicated in favour of his son. Segued died a few
months afterwards, still professing the Catholic faith. His
successor banished Mendez and his retinue, whereupon they sought
protection with the Prince of Bar, who had been at enmity with the
Abyssinian king; but this chieftain delivered them to the Turks.
Father Jerome Lobo, who wrote a history of the mission, and some of
his companions, reached Europe after many adventures; others were
ransomed from the Pasha of Souakim and proceeded to India, and the
few Jesuits who had remained in Abyssinia were put to death.</p>

<p>Of nine Capuchins who endeavoured to enter the country soon
after these events, seven were killed, the three who arrived last
being murdered by the Pasha of Souakim, at the Emperor of
Abyssinia’s request, as soon as they reached the coast.</p>

<p>No subsequent attempt of similar importance was made to convert
the Abyssinian nation to Catholicism, and the story of the struggle
between the Roman and the Alexandrian forms of belief may be said
to have ended with the banishment of Mendez.</p>

<p>There have been theological contentions in the Abyssinian Church
as in others, and it has not escaped schism. The fiercest dispute
arose about the number of the births of Christ, and the sword has
been used—as elsewhere—to lend force to arguments. Major Harris
wrote: “At the expense of a bloody civil war, Gondar, with Godjam,
Damot, and all the south-western provinces of Amhára, has long
maintained the three births of Christ—Christ proceeding from the
Father from all eternity, styled ‘the eternal birth;’ His
incarnation, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
being born of the holy Virgin, termed His ‘second or temporal
birth;’ and His reception of the Holy Ghost, denominated His ‘third
birth.’ The Tigre ecclesiastics, on the other hand, whose side is
invariably espoused by the Primate of Ethiopia, deny the third
birth, upon the ground that the reception of the Holy Ghost cannot
be so styled.”<a id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181"
class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Bishop Samuel Gobat, whose book was
published in 1834, gave a fuller account of the controversy, which
Parkyns quoted.<a id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182"
class="fnanchor">[182]</a> In Stern’s time the Abouna (primate) was
supported by King Theodore in his opposition to the doctrine of the
three births, and “the royal herald made proclamation that in
future all who adhered to the obnoxious dogma of the threefold
birth would be taught obedience by the <em>giraffe</em>
(scourging). The Shoa clergy denounced this decision as arbitrary
and tyrannical, as indeed it was; but an application of the
promised whip wrought a wonderful change among that insubordinate
body.”<a id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class=
"fnanchor">[183]</a> The same author on one occasion saw about a
dozen priests in chains, who were brought before the Abouna to be
admonished because “they had pertinaciously clung to the abolished
dogma of the three births of Christ.”<a id=
"FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class=
"fnanchor">[184]</a> The penalty which they incurred “consisted of
several months’ successive fasts, divers fines, and the promise of
the <em>giraffe</em>.”</p>

<p>For a detailed account of Abyssinian Christianity and
ecclesiastical history, reference should be made to the books
already mentioned in this volume—Bruce, Gobat, Harris, Lobo,
Legrand, Stern, Dufton, Plowden, and Parkyns especially—and to the
works of F. Alvarez<a id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185"
class="fnanchor">[185]</a><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_259">[259]</span> and Job Ludolphus.<a id=
"FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class=
"fnanchor">[186]</a> A digest of the writings of the early
travellers and missionaries in Abyssinia was published by F.
Balthazar Tellez, and translated into English by John Stevens
(1710).</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the Falashas (Jews) of
Abyssinia. These people, said Stern, “claiming a lineal descent
from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, pride themselves on the fame of
their progenitors and the purity of the blood that circulates in
their own veins. Intermarriages with those of another tribe or
creed are strictly interdicted,<a id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> nay, even the visit to
an unbeliever’s house is a sin, and subjects the transgressor to
the penance of a thorough lustration and a complete change of dress
before he can return to his own home. Their stern uncompromising
sectarian spirit has been highly beneficial in excluding from their
community that licentious profligacy in which all the other
inhabitants of Ethiopia riot; and it is generally admitted that
Falasha men and women seldom, if ever, stray from the path of
virtue, or transgress the solemn law of the decalogue.”<a id=
"FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class=
"fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Various accounts, of which two have already been mentioned, are
given of the origin of the Jewish colony in Abyssinia. It is
commonly believed among the people that a large retinue returned
with Maqueda, Queen of Sheba, from her visit to King Solomon.
Harris remarked, “The tradition of Queen Maqueda has
been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span> ascribed to
the invention of those fugitive Jews, who, after the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Emperor Titus, emigrated into the northern States
by way of the Red Sea, who disseminated it with the design of
obtaining the desired permission to settle in the country, and
whose descendants are the Falashas still extant among the mountains
of Simien and Lasta.”<a id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> According to Stern, “the
most probable conjecture is that at a very early period—perhaps
when Solomon’s fleet navigated the Red Sea—some adventurous Jews,
impelled by love of gain, settled among the pleasant hills of
Arabia Felix; whilst others of a more daring and enterprising
spirit were induced to try their fortune in the more remote
mountain scenes of Ethiopia. . . . Subsequent troubles in Palestine
and the final overthrow of the Jewish monarchy by Nebuchadnezzar
increased the number of the emigrants, and in the lapse of a few
centuries the Jews formed a powerful state in Arabia, and a
formidable and turbulent people in the Alpine regions between Tigre
and Amhara in Ethiopia.”<a id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Mr. Vivian alluded to “a
colony of aboriginal Jews up in the mountains of Tigre. They live
in pastoral fashion, like the old Hebrew patriarchs, upon the
produce of the flocks and herds. They have been there for
centuries, perhaps even for thousands of years, and the Abyssinians
confess that they have always failed to dislodge them from their
inaccessible fastnesses.”<a id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Falashas are also found
in the provinces bordering on Lake Tsana, including Godjam, and it
was in this district that Stern visited them. It seems probable
that the Jews who have retained their religion are the
descendants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span> of
those who refused to conform to the doctrines of the Coptic Church
when they were generally adopted in the country. Bruce mentions
that “about one hundred and eighty years after the establishment of
Christianity, a religious war is said to have taken place between
the converted and unconverted Abyssinians (the Christians and the
Jews),”<a id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class=
"fnanchor">[192]</a> and if one may judge by the steady and
successful opposition which Hebrews in other countries have offered
to the most strenuous methods of conversion, it appears likely that
a portion of those in Abyssinia adhered to their ancient creed.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that in the tenth century the Jews obtained
ascendency in Ethiopia, and preserved their supremacy for about
three centuries. “In the year 960 the Jews, supported by their king
and by his daughter Judith, a woman of great beauty, resolved to
attempt the subversion of the Christian religion and the
destruction of the race of Solomon (Queen Maqueda’s descendants
having been converted to the Alexandrian doctrines). They surprised
the mountain of Damo, the residence of the Christian princes, the
whole of whom, about four hundred, were massacred, excepting one
infant, who escaped into the powerful and loyal province of Shoa. A
solitary representative of the blood of Solomon and the Queen of
Sheba was thus preserved. Judith took possession of the throne, and
not only enjoyed it herself for forty years, but transmitted it to
five of her posterity. On the death of the last of these the crown
descended to one of his relations, a Christian, and is said to have
remained in his family (who, though Christians, were not of the
line of Solomon) for five generations. Finally, Tekla Haimanot, the
famous saint, persuaded the reigning king to restore the crown to
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span> house of
Solomon, whose descendants had survived in Shoa.”<a id=
"FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class=
"fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Differing accounts of the former political status of the Hebrews
in the land have been given by various writers; Stern said that in
their “mountain fastnesses of Simien and Bellesa they maintained,
under their own kings and queens, called Gideon and Judith, a
chequered and independent existence till the beginning of the
seventeenth century.”<a id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Harris, following Bruce
more closely, wrote, “Christianity became the national religion of
Abyssinia in the beginning of the fourth century. The Falashas,
descendants of the Jews who were believed to have accompanied
Menelek from Jerusalem, had meanwhile waxed extremely powerful, and
refusing to abandon the faith of their forefathers, they now
declared independence. Electing a sovereign of their own creed,
they took possession of the almost impregnable mountain fastnesses
of Simien, where their numbers were augmented by continual
accessions from the Jews who were expelled from Palestine and from
Arabia. Under the constant titles of Gideon and Judith, a
succession of kings and queens held a limited sway until, in the
middle of the <em>tenth</em> century,” the Princess Esther brought
about the revolution which Bruce ascribed to Judith—one writer
probably using the name and the other the title of the usurper in
question. Whatever the circumstances may really have been, there
seems reason to believe that the Jews were at one time sufficiently
influential to impose a dynasty of their choice upon the
nation.</p>

<p>Stern has given a full and very interesting account of the
Falashas whom he saw. According to this they<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_263">[263]</span> dwell as a rule, though not invariably,
apart from the remainder of the population, and “their settlements
are strikingly distinguished from the Christian villages by the red
earthen pot on the apex of their <em>mesquid</em>, or place of
worship, which towers from the centre of the thatched huts by which
it is environed. . . . Husbandry and a few simple trades—such as
smiths, potters, and weavers—constitute the sole occupations in
which they engage; commerce they unanimously repudiate as
incompatible with their Mosaic Creed, and it is quite a
disappointment not to find a single merchant among a quarter of a
million of people, the lineal descendants of those who are supposed
to have acquired a taste for traffic and riches on the very eve of
their emancipation from Egyptian servitude.”</p>

<p>Though they had very few copies of the Scriptures in Stern’s
time they were well acquainted with the Old Testament, especially
the Pentateuch and the Psalms. “Their sacrifices,” he wrote, “are
most capriciously offered, and with the exception of the Paschal
Lamb, neither the offering on the Sabbath nor on the day of
atonement is in accordance with the original command. . . . Every
Falasha settlement has a hut at its outskirts, and there the
unclean and impure must take refuge during the prescribed number of
days. This ritual scrupulosity involves many social hardships and
inflicts on numbers many a keen pang. Particularly in the hour of
dissolution, when the sweet expressions of friendship and love are
so soothing to the agonized soul and anguished frame, the dying
Falasha has no affectionate hand clasped in his, and no words of
comfort from beloved objects whispered in his ears. The inflexible
law forbids the last offices to the weeping relative, and the
helpless sufferer is in death’s agonizing<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_264">[264]</span> convulsions dragged from the weary couch
into the open air, where the polluted and unclean remove him from
the bare ground to the tainted and lonely hut.”</p>

<p>On the Sabbath “the service, which consists in chanting psalms
and hymns relieved by allegorical stories and a few verses or a
chapter of the book of Leviticus, lasts a considerable time, and in
some places the plaintive notes of the worshippers may even be
heard across the quiet valley and around the lonely hill throughout
the night. . . . Broad phylacteries and the garments of fringes are
utterly unknown among them, nor do they wash the cup or practise
any of the decrees of the rabbins. . . . About the advent of the
Messiah they have no intelligent or definite idea. ‘We believe that
Jerusalem will again be rebuilt,’ is the answer on the lip of every
Falasha, when questioned as to the future destiny of his nation.
This event they regard as the consummation of their brightest
hopes—the realization of their fondest mundane visions. . . .”</p>

<p>Asceticism, borrowed from the Christian hermits, has become a
practice among the Falasha priests, who “after their initiation
frequently pass months and years in swampy marshes, stern wilds and
poisonous jungles, where roots or dried peas, which latter they
carry with them, are their only means of subsistence. Numbers
succumb to the noxious influence of the atmosphere, others perish
of famine, whilst not a few become the prey of the lion, hyena, and
other voracious beasts which inhabit those unsightly tracts.” There
are also Falasha monks, and “the dwellings and convents of these
ascetics are carefully isolated from the abodes of the impure and
unholy people.”</p>

<p>There were, in Stern’s day, three Falasha high-priests in
Abyssinia, one in the province of Quara, the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_265">[265]</span> other in Armatgioho, and the third, Aboo
Maharee, in Dembea. The missionary had some indecisive discussion
with the last-named, a man about sixty years of age, “of a noble
and commanding figure, swathed in a white <em>shama</em>, and
holding a long bamboo staff, which in the distance looked like the
crosier of a bishop.” He had a “high and expressive forehead,
melancholy restless eyes, and a countenance once no doubt mild and
pleasing, but to which self-imposed penances and a repulsive
practice had imparted an expression most strange and
unearthly.”</p>

<p>“The common people have all an erect, upright carriage;” the
women are intelligent and <i>sympathiques</i>, and the younger of
them attractive. To judge by Stern’s description,<a id=
"FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class=
"fnanchor">[195]</a> the Falashas are generally a worthy, simple
and devout race, bigoted but “exemplary in their morals, and
cleanly in their habits”—in which latter respect they form a
striking contrast to their co-religionists in the slums of London.
Plowden said of the Abyssinian Jews, “They are still found in some
numbers, and, though despised, are not persecuted; this may be
owing to their poverty. They know nothing of the Hebrew tongue, but
some read the Mosaic books in Geez, and are as scrupulous in their
ceremonials as their brethren elsewhere. They are the best masons
in the country.”<a id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196"
class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>“The <em>mesquids</em>, like the Christian churches, consist of
three divisions, with an entrance towards the east. The admission
into these different courts is rigorously regulated by Levitical
law, and the severest penalty would be inflicted on any one who
should incautiously pollute the sacred edifice. In the rear of
every place of worship is a small enclosure with a huge stone in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> centre; and on
this crude altar the victim is slaughtered, and all other
sacrificial rites performed.”<a id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>For a notice of a curious superstition of which a class of
Jewish people are often the object among Christian Abyssinians, see
<a href="#Page_288" class="pginternal">p. 288.</a></p>

<p>In the “Jewish Year-Book”<a id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> for 1904 the number of
Jews in Abyssinia is computed at 50,000; the “American Jewish Year
Book” estimates it to be 120,000. Both these figures must be
conjectural, and the former differs very widely from that given by
Stern, who had had opportunities of obtaining information in the
country. Considering the fecundity of the Jews in most parts of the
world it is unlikely that their numbers have diminished in Ethiopia
during the last forty years.</p>

<p>In Plowden’s time there was a large and prosperous Mohammedan
population in Abyssinia. He wrote: “In all large towns they have a
separate quarter, with mosques and public prayers. From the
advantage that their commerce in slaves gives them over their
Christian competitors, the Mussulman traders are the most wealthy,
and are, therefore, generally appointed to the high post of Negadeh
Ras, or collector of all customs, literally ‘head of merchants.’ To
enforce their authority these keep large bodies of armed men, and
confidently predict the final triumph of the faith of the Prophet
in Abyssinia. The Abyssinian Mussulmans, as distinguished from the
Galla, are all traders; they will not eat meat killed by
Christians, and are frequently their superiors in morality and
intelligence. They live on terms of equality, good humour and
friendship with the Christians, openly defend their creed, and
receive any proselyte that offers, and do not appear to think that
the restrictions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span> in
the Koran respecting strong drinks apply to them at all.” Plowden
added that they, like the Christians, did not generally seclude
their women.</p>

<p>King Theodore, early in his reign, issued an edict which
“required peremptorily the expulsion from the country, or the
instant return to the bosom of the Church of his apostate
countrymen,” <i>i.e.</i> Mohammedans.<a id=
"FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class=
"fnanchor">[199]</a> Circumstances prevented him from enforcing
this decree. It was revived by King Johannes, and no doubt, had in
other parts of Abyssinia the effect which Stecker observed in
Korata.<a id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class=
"fnanchor">[200]</a> But Mohammedans are still to be
found—<i>e.g.</i> in the district of Axum<a id=
"FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class=
"fnanchor">[201]</a> and in Shoa.<a id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to the Waitos.<a id=
"FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class=
"fnanchor">[203]</a> Plowden wrote of them: “They call themselves
Mohammedans, but are not recognized by the other followers of that
creed. They principally reside near the Lake Tsana, and are a very
handsome race. They are regarded with as much aversion as the
Jews.”<a id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class=
"fnanchor">[204]</a> It must be owned that the appreciation of
their personal appearance is a matter of taste.</p>

<p>Another singular sect is that known as Koomants, or Kamants.
These people, “found only in the neighbourhood of Gondar, are
acknowledged by neither Christian, Mussulman, or Jew, and have a
bastard creed, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
compound of all three. They are skilful carpenters, and supply all
Gondar with wood. They are despised, but being very courageous, and
having lately shown an inclining towards Christianity, it is not
improbable that their distinctions will soon disappear; many even
now have ceased a practice which was the chief separating cause.
They hung heavy weights in the lobe of the ear of the girls, who
are thereby excluded from any chance of marriage with
Christians.”<a id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class=
"fnanchor">[205]</a> Hormuzd Rassam on one occasion halted at a
village of Kamants called Saraba, north of Lake Tsana, in the
direction of Gondar. He saw there “a place of worship, which they
hold in great veneration. The entire space between the spring and
this temple, or, more strictly, grove—they have no building for
their religious services—is regarded as sacred, and no Christian or
Mohammedan is allowed to enter within the hallowed precincts. When
engaged in prayer, they take up a position under a tree, on the
banks of the stream, or in the wood about half a mile from the
spring. It is owing to this practice that the Christian Abyssinians
style them ‘Worshippers of wood,’ or simply ‘Wood.’ Their religion
is as great a mystery in Abyssinia as that of the Ansairies is in
Syria, and although the late king (Theodore) obliged them to wear
the ‘mateb’ cord, yet they still continue to practise certain rites
and ceremonies unknown either to Christians or Mussulmans. They
only eat meat which has been slaughtered by themselves, and eschew
fish and coffee; yet they adopt Christian names, and have a kind of
baptism, which their Christian countrymen designate a
‘mockery.’”<a id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class=
"fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>Stern’s first
experience of these people was agreeable. In a deep valley called
Walee Dubba, on the way to Tschelga, he met some young women who
had jars of <em>dallah</em>, a beer made from sprouting barley, to
sell. “It was quite an unexpected surprise,” he wrote, “to see the
solitude of an African wilderness enlivened with the gay song and
sprightly converse of a number of young lasses, who, clad in
rustling leather petticoats, moved about amongst the various groups
resting under the leafy foliage, with a grace and innate modesty
which elicited admiration, whilst at the same time it forbad all
unbecoming liberty.” At Tschelga he questioned some of the Kamants
“about their knowledge of God and their hopes of eternity; but they
had so little to communicate, beyond a belief in a Supreme Being
and the existence of a future state, that the most simple query
caused them the utmost wonder and surprise. . . . Their language is
Amharic, but amongst themselves they speak in the Falasha tongue;
and the striking Jewish features of many a man and woman amongst
them inclined us to credit the report which assigns to them a
Jewish origin.” The same writer has mentioned the legendary
derivation of their name,<a id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and he described them as
industrious, energetic, and active. He saw many of their women in
Gondar, and remarked that “it was a strange sight to see these
young females—clad in simple leather petticoats and equally simple
earrings of wood, which, according to the orthodox fashion, must be
weighty enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span> to
distend in a few years the flap of the ear down to the
shoulders—walking about in the market, or groaning under a heavy
burden of wood, utterly unconcerned about everything except the
graceful ornament that dangled round their necks.”<a id=
"FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class=
"fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>At the present time European creeds are represented in Abyssinia
by converts, whose change of faith is due to the activity of
missionaries. Mr. Wylde wrote upon this subject—“I believe the
majority of the Abyssinians care a great deal for their religion,
and it is only the more worthless ones that are found round the
different mission stations; people who are willing to change their
faith the same as they would their clothes, and when they have worn
out all that are to be got, revert to their original one again,
without perhaps being any the better or any the worse for the
experience, but only to be marked by others as being utterly
worthless and unreliable characters. I will never have a male
servant in my employ that has been near a mission, if I can help
it. Female servants are different; they usually are taught to sew,
wash, and cook, and are generally cleanly in their habits, but when
they get to a certain age the majority of them run away from these
establishments, as they cannot stand the discipline and restraint;
and I don’t blame them, as a more unlovely and monotonous life does
not exist.”<a id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class=
"fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>There is a code of law in Abyssinia, which is called <em>Fatha
Negest</em>, or <em>Feth Negust</em>. According to Major Harris
this volume of “The Judgments of the Kings” is said to have fallen
from heaven in the time of Constantine the Great, and he includes
it among the books of which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_271">[271]</span> MSS. are still extant in the country.<a id=
"FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class=
"fnanchor">[210]</a> Plowden stated that it was supposed “to have
been compiled by the Council of Three Hundred, in the earlier ages
of the Church, and regarded originally as of almost equal authority
with the sacred writings.”<a id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> He further remarked that
this code “is a bad translation from that of Justinian; three parts
of it being occupied with Church affairs and regulations, and a
small portion only with the civil and criminal law, this latter
being also much mixed up with the institutions of the Pentateuch.
Bad as it is, there are probably not twenty persons in the country
that are conversant with it; and some singular judgments are given
on its authority, much after the fashion of the <i>sortes
Virgilianæ</i>. Though it is consulted with much ceremony, and
considered a sacred volume, law is, in fact, simplified to the will
of the chief. Still, the fact of there being a written law has
assisted in retarding the degradation of the people.”<a id=
"FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class=
"fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The following extract from Parkyns’s work shows the spirit of
Ethiopian jurisprudence in dealing with serious crime: “As for the
laws of the country, they are for the most part formed on the basis
of the old Mosaic dispensation. ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for
a tooth’ is followed nearly to the letter—so much so that, if a man
kill another, the murderer must be put to death by the nearest
relatives of the deceased with precisely the same kind of weapon as
that with which he killed his victim.”<a id=
"FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class=
"fnanchor">[213]</a> The murderer may redeem his life by paying a
ransom, which, in Stern’s time, varied from fifty to two hundred
and fifty Maria Theresa dollars.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_272">[272]</span> If he did not possess the requisite amount
he was chained to a relative of the deceased and obliged to beg
till he had collected the stipulated sum. The severity of the
punishments in vogue varies with the temperament of different
rulers, the Emperor being the final authority in such matters, and
a right of appeal to him is admitted in favour of all accused
persons.<a id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class=
"fnanchor">[214]</a> Mutilation is a common penalty.<a id=
"FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class=
"fnanchor">[215]</a> “This,” said Mr. Wylde, “has not the terrors
that it would have in England, as some of the thieves in Abyssinia
have been operated on a second and a third time, and I saw one man
with his left foot being the only extremity left, and he was being
fed by the priests at the church at Adowa.”<a id=
"FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class=
"fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>All Abyssinian litigants are required to find security. “These
securities must be persons whom the judge is certain of being able
to seize if necessary. If the charge be serious they must be
persons of property, and are liable both for the appearance of
their principals, and for the sentence whatever that may be. This
custom obtains both in civil and criminal law. In default of such
security, each party is chained by the wrist; an additional
expense, as the chains must be hired, and the jailor—that is, the
person to whom he is chained, paid a sum fixed by law. This bail is
the prop of Abyssinian society; no commercial or market transfer
takes place without it. The Abyssinian judge or creditor cares
nothing for the principal in a cause; the bail is seized, and in
self-defence produces his man; and it is an honourable trait that
the principal rarely absconds. A friend will thus become security
in a case of murder, though rendering himself thereby
liable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span> to suffer
death, or to pay the price of blood, to them a fortune.</p>

<p>“After both parties have given security the plaintiff only is
allowed to produce his witnesses; the defendant can, when they are
called by name, admit or reject their evidence, in almost every
case great indulgence being shown in this respect. . . . In small
affairs, such as a sudden dispute on the high road, the meeting of
an absconded debtor, or any civil matter, the first decent person
to be found is obliged to act as a temporary judge, if adjured by
the ‘death of the chief’ paramount. He must then place the accused
in bonds, which is done by tying his cloth (<em>shama</em>) to that
of his accuser, and escort or send them to the nearest magistrate,
who, should the accused demand it, must in like manner forward him
to his immediate master or chief, where the case is first heard,
the plaintiff having right of appeal; the law in this being,
however, highly favourable to the defendant, the plaintiff not
being always disposed for a long journey.”<a id=
"FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class=
"fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Every man is his own advocate. Those who wish to read an account
of the proceedings “in court” should refer to “Modern Abyssinia,”
p. 308, or “Wanderings among the Falashas,” pp. 48, 170. The
hearing usually gives occasion for a good deal of eloquence and a
great deal of lying.</p>

<p>There is no sort of general education in Abyssinia. Men of
attainments are found in the upper classes, and some of the higher
officials are capable linguists. But as regards the bulk of the
nation learning has advanced little since the days of Harris. “The
stores of literature being bound up in a dead letter (the Geez
language), few excepting the priests and <em>defterers</em> can
decipher them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span> and
many of these learned men are often more indebted to the memory of
their early youth than to the well-thumbed page in their hand. The
ignorance of the nation is, indeed, truly deplorable; for those
children only receive the rudiments of an education who are
designed for the service of the Church; and, the course of study
adopted being little calculated to expand the mind of the neophyte,
a peculiar deficiency is presented in intellectual features.”<a id=
"FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class=
"fnanchor">[218]</a> Plowden remarked of the priests that they
“teach but one book to the children of the laity, ‘The Psalms of
David;’ and without forbidding other learning, discourage it,
confining it as much as possible to the clergy and the
scribes.”<a id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class=
"fnanchor">[219]</a> Allusion has already been made to the classes
held by the priests in the precincts of the churches.<a id=
"FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class=
"fnanchor">[220]</a> Such instruction as is obtainable is given, of
course, to all pupils under clerical supervision. There are no
secular schools, and at the present time, as Mr. Vivian remarked,
“no one in Abyssinia ever does get any education beyond learning to
read and write, and quote passages from the Gospels.”<a id=
"FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class=
"fnanchor">[221]</a> Those whose acquirements exceed this standard
are not indebted for them to native teachers.</p>

<p>The habits of the young girls, among the generality of the
people, do not foster any strict notions of morality. Parkyns
wrote: “The boys are turned out wild to look after the sheep and
cattle, and the girls, from early childhood, are sent to fetch
water from the well or brook, first in a gourd, and afterwards in a
jar proportioned to their strength. If the well be far from the
village, the girls usually form parties to go thither and amuse
themselves on the road by singing sentimental or love songs; while,
during their halt at the well for an hour or so, they<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> engage in romps of all kinds,
in which parties of the other sex frequently join. This early
licence lays the foundation for worse, when at a later period they
are sent to the woods to collect fuel.”<a id=
"FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class=
"fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Courtship can hardly be said to exist. “In Abyssinia young
people begin to think of marriage at a very early age. I have seen
brides of eight or nine years old; and boys at a proportionally
youthful age are considered marriageable. When a lad wishes to
marry he only inquires for a girl who may possess twice the number
of oxen that he can muster, or their value. His proposals are made
to the girl’s father, and, unless there is some strong motive for
rejecting him, he is accepted, and everything is arranged without
consulting the lady’s taste or asking her consent. They are usually
betrothed three or four months before marriage, during which time
the bridegroom frequently visits his father-in-law elect, and
occasionally propitiates him with presents of honey, butter, a
sheep, or a goat; but he is never allowed to see his intended wife
even for a moment, unless, by urgent entreaty or a handsome bribe,
he induces some female friend of hers to arrange the matter, by
procuring him a glance at his cruel fair one. For this purpose he
conceals himself behind a door or other convenient hiding-place,
while the lady, on some pretext or other, is led past it. Should
she, however, suspect a trick, and discover him, she would make a
great uproar, cover her face, and, screaming, run away and hide
herself, as though her sense of propriety were greatly offended by
the intrusion; although previous to his making the offer she would
have thought it no harm to romp with him, or any other male
acquaintance, in the most free and easy manner. Even after she has
been betrothed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span> she
is at home to every one, except to him who most sighs for the light
of her countenance.</p>

<p>“In Tigre, and especially in Shire, there is a superstition that
if a girl leave her father’s house during the interval between her
betrothal and marriage she will be bitten by a snake.</p>

<p>“When the wedding day approaches the girl is well washed, her
hair combed and tressed, and she is rendered in every way as
agreeable as possible. She has then to undergo a course of diet and
medicine.”<a id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class=
"fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>Of marriages there are three kinds. The foregoing extract refers
to the usual merely civil contract; for such unions there are
“bridesmen” (<em>arkees</em>), who have peculiar privileges in the
community, including that of theft, remain “on duty” after the
nuptials, and occupy the most singular relation to the newly wedded
damsel.<a id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class=
"fnanchor">[224]</a> There are also bridesmaids, who keep their
faces covered during the wedding, which is a very simple ceremony.
Mr. Wylde and an Italian friend obtained an illicit view of an
Abyssinian bride and bridesmaids, and were rewarded by the sight of
some very charming girls. Both he and Parkyns have written
entertaining descriptions of an Abyssinian marriage of this
kind.<a id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class=
"fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>Rassam has given the following particulars with regard to such
contracts. “The parties simply swear, in the presence of two
witnesses, that they will live together as husband and wife. This
bond may be dissolved at any time by mutual consent; in that case,
the wife is entitled to retain whatever property she possessed
before wedlock, as also any presents which she may have received
from her husband during coverture, unless a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_277">[277]</span> stipulation to the contrary was agreed
to by both sides, on their union. Most Abyssinian marriages are of
this sort, and the generality of the respectable classes so wedded
live together as husband and wife until separated by death.”<a id=
"FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class=
"fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>Harris wrote: “In Shoa a girl is reckoned according to the value
of her property; and the heiress to a house, a field, and a
bedstead is certain to add a husband to her list before many
summers have shone over her head. Marriage is generally concluded
by the parties declaring, before witnesses, ‘upon the life of the
King,’ that they intend to live happily together, and the property
of each being produced is carefully appraised. A mule or an ass, a
dollar, a shield and a sheaf of spears on the one side,<a id=
"FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class=
"fnanchor">[227]</a> are noted against the lady’s stock of wheat,
cotton, and household gear; and the bargain being struck, the
effects become joint for the time, until some domestic difference
results in either taking up their own, and departing to seek a new
mate.</p>

<p>“Favourite slaves and concubines are respected as much as wedded
wives. No distinction is made betwixt legitimate and illegitimate
children; and, to the extent of his means, every subject follows
the example set by the monarch (Sahela Selassie), who, it has been
seen, entertains upon his establishment, in addition to his lawful
spouse, no fewer than five hundred concubines.</p>

<p>“Few married couples even live long together without violating
their vow; and the dereliction being held of small account, a
beating is the only punishment inflicted upon the weaker party. The
jewel chastity is here in no repute; and the utmost extent of
reparation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span> to be
recovered in a court of justice for the most aggravated case of
seduction is but fivepence sterling.</p>

<p>“Morality is thus at the very lowest ebb; for there is neither
custom nor inducement to be chaste, and beads, more precious than
fine gold, bear down every barrier of restraint. Honesty and
modesty both yield to the force of temptation, and pride is seldom
offended at living in a state of indolent dependence upon others.
The soft savage requires but little inducement to follow the bent
of her passions according to the dictates of unenlightened nature;
and neither scruples of conscience nor the rules of the loose
society form any obstacle whatever to their entire
gratification.”<a id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228"
class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>Plowden confirms the observation that “no distinction is made
between legitimate and illegitimate children,” and adds, “all share
alike on the decease of their father.”<a id=
"FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class=
"fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The reader will have noticed that Rassam’s account of the
duration and even tenour of these alliances does not agree with the
comments made by Harris. Stern observed that the wedded pair “may,
perhaps, become attached to each other and live in peace and
conjugal bliss; or, as it frequently happens, they may become
disgusted with each other after the lapse of a brief period and
separate.”<a id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class=
"fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Parkyns wrote:—“The civil marriage may be dissolved on the
shortest notice and for the most trifling reasons. Parties have
only to express their wish to separate, and a division of property
and children takes place. The boys, if there be any, usually go to
the father, and the girls to the mother. This having
been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span> done, the
parties are at liberty to contract a second marriage as soon as
they please. It is not an uncommon thing for a man thus separated
from his wife to maintain her in a house near his own, furnish her
with the necessary means of subsistence for herself and family, and
continue apparently in perfect friendship with her, while at the
same time he takes another bride in her place.”<a id=
"FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class=
"fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>The custom of entering into civil contracts of this kind is of
old standing; for Lobo remarked, “A husband that doth not like his
wife may easily find means to make the marriage void; and, what is
worse, may dismiss the second wife with less difficulty than he
took her, and return to the first; so that marriages in this
country are only for a term of years, and last no longer than both
parties are pleased with each other; which is one instance how far
distant these people are from the purity of the primitive
believers, which they pretend to have preserved with so great
strictness. The marriages are, in short, no more than bargains,
made with this proviso that when any discontent shall arise on
either side, they may separate, and marry whom they please, each
taking back what they brought with them.”<a id=
"FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class=
"fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>According to Mr. Vivian, provision is sometimes made at the time
of the secular marriage for the event of divorce—“a certain sum is
agreed upon for payment by the husband. My friend, the
coffee-planter at Harrar, had to promise to pay £10 to his little
Galla wife if ever he sent her away, but that was considered an
exceptionally heavy fee.”<a id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>There are, however, nuptials of greater sanctity.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> Rassam thus described them:
“The most binding marriage with the Abyssinians consists of an
interchange of vows between the bridegroom and bride, confirmed by
their jointly partaking of the holy Eucharist; in fact, the union
in this case is solemnized much in the same way as in other
Christian Churches. Here, however, as elsewhere, certain breaches
of their mutual vows by either party dissolves the tie and renders
the transgressor legally obnoxious to punishment; but as Abyssinian
law in such matters has been disregarded for centuries, and Might
has taken the place of Right, it follows that an offending husband
generally escapes with impunity; so also does the guilty wife, if
she happens to belong to the family of a powerful chief. Hence, an
unprincipled husband, when tired of his wife, finds no difficulty
whatever in getting rid of her; and such repudiation is undoubtedly
very common. Many cases of the kind fell under my own cognizance,
and, in nearly all, the husbands were leading incontinent lives; on
the other hand, I never heard of a single instance of a wife who
had been sacramentally married proving unfaithful to her husband,
even after his repudiation of her. Most women so situated remain
single, and many become nuns. In consequence of this deplorable
state of things, Abyssinian females generally entertain a great
distrust of the opposite sex, and not one in twenty would willingly
contract the more binding marriage.”<a id=
"FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class=
"fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Vivian confirmed this observation. “Marriage is not popular
with the women,” he wrote, “in either of these countries”
(Abyssinia and Somaliland), “and they will only consent to it when
physical force is actually used.” He added, with regard to
Abyssinia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span> “The
permanent marriage seems to be very rare, only priests and persons
of extraordinary piety indulging in it.”<a id=
"FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class=
"fnanchor">[235]</a> It is to be hoped that these worthies do not
resort to violence in order to gratify their wish. Plowden said of
this form of wedlock, that “it is usual in old age only to take the
sacrament together in the church, thereby pledging themselves to
fidelity.”<a id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class=
"fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless this account of the Abyssinian usage is correct, for
it agrees with the observations made by Parkyns. “Church
marriages,” he wrote, “are rarely solemnized except between
persons, who, having first been civilly married, and having
afterwards lived happily together till the decline of life, begin
to feel that they could not hope to suit themselves better, and so
determine to sanctify the marriage by going to church and partaking
of the Sacrament. The bond is then considered indissoluble.”<a id=
"FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class=
"fnanchor">[237]</a> Stern stated that the Negus is in the same
position as the clergy with regard to monogamy.<a id=
"FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class=
"fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>“According to the canons of the Abyssinian Church, the King is
bound by the same marital laws as a priest; and, consequently, if
his wife dies, he dare not marry another. The bereaved predecessors
of Theodoros scrupulously evaded such a contingency by substituting
the regularly stored harem in the place of the one lawful
wife.”<a id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class=
"fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Rassam made the following observations on the third form of
wedlock: “This last is little better than concubinage. The
contracting parties merely engage to cohabit during pleasure, and
while so living are regarded as husband and wife. The national
Church recognizes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
only the sacramental marriage as valid; but the laity, as a rule,
set all ecclesiastical law in such matters at defiance. Hence, a
wealthy Abyssinian Christian, who is debarred by the two higher
degrees of wedlock from having more than one wife, may nevertheless
have as many third-rate wives as he pleases, and cohabit with them
simultaneously. In the course of my inquiries into these
matrimonial customs, and the laws affecting inheritances among this
peculiar people, I applied to the Abouna to aid me in the research.
His reply was, ‘My son, you have asked me questions which I am
unable to answer. This only I can tell you; Abyssinian marriages,
with few exceptions, are so abominably revolting that the issue are
all bastards.’”<a id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240"
class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>From the opinions quoted it may be judged that the inclination
towards conjugal constancy is usually greater in the wife than in
the husband, but this is not invariably the case. Rassam tells the
following story of a couple at Magdala. “The husband was in such
dread of losing his partner, knowing that, as he had been united to
her by the secondary (civil) marriage only, she might leave him any
day, that her refusal to accompany him to the altar, there to
partake of the Lord’s Supper with him, in token of their more
indissoluble union, nearly drove him mad. The matter was eventually
referred to the Abouna, my intervention being also sought, and
after considerable trouble we overcame the obstinacy of the lady,
and induced her to be sacramentally joined to her lovesick
lord.”<a id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class=
"fnanchor">[241]</a> Of course this may have been only an instance
of an Ethiopian woman’s mistrust of the male sex.</p>

<p>Lobo gave some curious details of the penalties that<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> followed upon infidelity when
he was in the country. “They have here a particular way of
punishing adultery: A woman convicted of that crime is condemned to
forfeit all her fortune, is turned out of her husband’s house in a
mean dress, and is forbid ever to enter it again. She has only a
needle given her to get her living with. Sometimes her head is
shaved, except one lock of hair which is left her, and even that
depends on the will of her husband, who has it likewise in his
choice whether he will receive her again or not. If he resolves
never to admit her, they are both at liberty to marry whom they
will. There is another custom amongst them yet more extraordinary,
which is, that the wife is punished whenever the husband proves
false to the marriage-contract; this punishment indeed extends no
farther than a pecuniary mulct; and what seems more equitable, the
husband is obliged to pay a sum to his wife. When the husband
prosecutes his wife’s gallant, if he can produce any proofs of a
criminal conversation, he recovers, for damages, forty cows, forty
horses, and forty suits of clothes, and the same number of other
things. If the gallant be unable to pay him, he is committed to
prison, and continues there during the husband’s pleasure; who, if
he sets him at liberty before the whole fine is paid, obliges him
to take an oath that he is going to procure the rest, that he may
be able to make full satisfaction. Then the criminal orders meat
and drink to be brought out, they eat and drink together; he asks a
formal pardon, which is not granted at first; however, the husband
forgives first one part of the debt, and then another, till at
length the whole is remitted.”<a id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>According to Mr. Wylde, Abyssinian girls have many attractions
for men. “They perfectly understand the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_284">[284]</span> utility of ‘feeding the beast’ with a nice
dinner to keep him good-tempered, and from what I have seen of
these young ladies, they do everything they possibly can to make a
man happy, and being good-tempered, jolly girls, they seldom ‘nag,’
and no wonder the southern Italians have taken a liking for them,
and find themselves perfectly happy in their society.” He admits
that “their great drawback is their dirtiness;” but adds, “all
those that get the chance of being clean keep themselves very neat
and tidy.” However, “nearly all the lower-class Abyssinian women
use oil or fat for their heads; this they do to keep the small
parasites quiet, as they cannot get about when the head and hair
are thickly besmeared and saturated, and the oil or fat also serves
for softening the skin of the face and preventing it from chapping
in the cold weather, or blistering during the hot season of the
year.”<a id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class=
"fnanchor">[243]</a> Mr. Vivian remarked of the Ethiopian woman,
“though her features are comely, she is not the sort of person one
would care to choose as a companion. For one thing, I do not
suppose that she ever washes herself in her life, the butter on her
hair grows rancid and emits a peculiarly pungent odour, which
affronts the nostrils when you pass her in the desert, and wherever
she goes she carries with her a large black cluster of flies
congregated on her back.”<a id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Probably she would “find
herself” under the influence of a cleaner civilization.</p>

<p>Conceptions of medicine among the Abyssinians have changed for
the better during recent years. Harris has given an account of some
of the singular notions and practices which prevailed in his day.
He took a supply of medical stores into the country,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span> and he and the doctor with the
expedition (Assistant-Surgeon Kirk) acted as physicians
extraordinary to the King, with the following results:—</p>

<p>“The most particular inquiries were instituted relative to the
mode of counteracting the influence of the evil eye, and much
disappointment expressed at the unavoidable intimation that the
dispensary of the foreigners contained neither ‘the horn of a
serpent,’ which is believed to afford an invaluable antidote
against witchcraft; no preservative against wounds in the
battlefield, nor any nostrum for ‘those who go mad from looking at
a mad dog.’ ‘We princes also fear the small-pox,’ said his Majesty,
‘and therefore never tarry long in the same place. Nagási, my
illustrious ancestor, suffered martyrdom from this scourge. Have
you no medicine to drive it from myself?’</p>

<p>“Vaccine lymph there was in abundance, but neither Christian,
Moslem, nor Pagan had yet consented to make trial of its virtues.
Glasses hermetically sealed, betwixt which the perishable fluid had
been deposited, were exhibited, and its use expounded. ‘No, no!’
quoth the King, as he delivered the acquisition to his master of
the horse, with a strict injunction to have it carefully stitched
in leather, ‘this is <em>talakh medanit</em>, very potent medicine
indeed; and henceforth I must wear it as a talisman against the
evil that beset my forefathers.’</p>

<p>“‘You must now give me the medicine which draws the vicious
waters from the leg,’ resumed his Majesty, ‘and which is better
than earth from Mount Lebanon; the medicine which disarms venomous
snakes, and that which turns the grey hairs black; the medicine to
destroy the worm in the ear of the Queen which is ever burrowing
deeper; and, above all, the medicine of the seven colours, which so
sharpens the intellect as to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_286">[286]</span> enable him who swallows enough of it to
acquire every sort of knowledge without the slightest trouble.
Furthermore, you will be careful to give my people <em>none of
this</em>.’”<a id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class=
"fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>Plowden, writing of the <em>defterers</em>, said: “They are
often more learned than the priests, and equally take advantage of
the general ignorance. Their principal gain is by writing amulets
and charms against every disease, almost against death. . . . They
also profess medicine, and as they do not much analyze the effects
of their drugs, many an unfortunate falls a victim to some
poisonous plant administered as a love philtre. Most of them are
hangers-on of the different churches; they are generally cunning,
debauched, and mischief-makers.”<a id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Wylde, speaking of the Abyssinian clergy of the present
time, says, “They know that the days are gone by when every one
came to them for some charm or a little holy water to cure a
complaint; the very practical nineteenth-century doctor is to be
found, and not only the congregation has deserted to the modern
school of medicine, but the priest himself will trust in the new
treatment in preference to running the risk in getting cured by
faith or unfiltered holy water.”<a id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>A peculiar disease is found in Abyssinia, chiefly but not
exclusively among the women. Dufton describes a typical case: “I
had the satisfaction of seeing in Gaffat a case of <em>bouda</em>.
This term is given to a phenomenon of mental abstraction, which the
natives explain as ‘being possessed by the devil.’ The case I am
about to mention happened to a female in the service of one
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span> the Europeans.
Her symptoms began in a kind of fainting fit, in which the fingers
were clenched in the palms of the hands, the eyes glazed, the
nostrils distended, and the whole body stiff and inflexible.
Afterwards she commenced a hideous laugh in imitation of the hyena,
and began running about on all fours; she was then seized by the
bystanders, and a <em>bouda</em> doctor having been called in, this
individual began questioning her as to the person who had possessed
her with this hyena devil. She said he was a man living in
Gooderoo, south of Abyssinia, and also told how long the spirit
would be in possession, and what was required to expel him. Great
care must be taken of persons thus afflicted, as cases of this kind
sometimes end in death. All their demands for dress, food, trifles
of any sort, must be strictly attended to. In the height of the
frenzy they will sometimes carry out the idea of their hyena
identity to such an extent as to attack any animal that may happen
to be in the way. One woman fancied she would like a little
donkey-flesh; so to gratify her strange taste she seized hold by
her teeth to the hinder part of one which happened to be near. Off
went the astonished beast at a pace that nothing in the form of
persuasion will lead him to adopt for the gratification of man.
Off, too, clinging tight with her teeth to his haunches, went the
frenzied girl. Only force would induce her to forego the tender
morsel.</p>

<p>“They have several cures for this strange attack; but the
never-failing one is a mixture of some obscene filth, which is
concealed in some part of the house, whereupon the woman is said to
go directly, on all fours, to where it is and swallow it. This
would seem incredible, but thousands of corroborative facts, known
to Abyssinian residents, put it beyond a doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>“The power of
possessing persons with the devil is attributed mostly to Jewish
blacksmiths; and women and children are terrified when they meet,
in a solitary place, a blacksmith who is a Jew. These sorcerers are
also said to be endued with the power of changing the shape of the
object of their incantations.”<a id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>Stern has given some interesting particulars with regard to
these seizures. “During the rainy season, when the weather, like
the mind, is cheerless and dull, the <em>boudas</em>, as if in
mockery of the universal gloom, celebrate their saturnalia. In our
small settlement, the monotony of our existence was constantly
diversified by a <em>bouda</em> scene. Towards the close of August,
when every shrub and tree began to sprout and blossom, the disease
degenerated into a regular epidemic; and in the course of an
evening two, three, and not unfrequently every hut occupied by
natives would ring with that familiar household cry. A heavy
thunderstorm, by some mysterious process, seemed invariably to
predispose the people to the <em>bouda’s</em> torturing
influence.</p>

<p>“I remember one day, about the end of August, we had a most
terrific tempest. . . . The noise and tumult of the striving
elements had scarcely subsided, when a servant of Mr. Mayer, a
stout, robust, and masculine woman, began to exhibit the
<em>bouda</em> symptoms. She had been complaining the whole noon of
languor, faintness, and utter incapacity for all physical exertion.
About sunset her lethargy increased, and she gradually sank into a
state of apparent unconsciousness. Her fellow-servants, who were
familiar with the cause of the complaint, at once pronounced her to
be possessed. To outwit the conjuror, I thought it advisable to try
the effect of strong liquid ammonia on the nerves of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span> Evil One. The
place being dark, faggots were ignited; and in their bright
flickering light we beheld a mass of dark figures squatted on the
wet floor around a rigid, motionless, and apparently dead woman. I
instantly applied my bottle to her nose; but although the potent
smell made all near raise a cry of terror, it produced no more
effect on the passive and insensible patient than if it had been
water from the newly formed rivulets.”</p>

<p>The landlord of the settlement, “an amateur exorcist, almost by
instinct, as if anticipating something wrong in that part of his
domains occupied by the Franks, made his appearance in the very
nick of time. This bloated and limping dotard, who had wasted his
youth and manhood in folly and vice, for which, in his old age, he
sought to atone by discarding one after the other of his former
wives, and by poring over the legends of saints and martyrs, no
sooner hobbled into the hut than the possessed woman, as if struck
by a magnetic wire, burst into loud fits of laughter and the
paroxysms of a raving maniac. Half a dozen stalwart fellows caught
hold of her, but frenzy imparted a vigour to her frame which even
the united strength of these athletes was barely sufficient to keep
under control. She tried to bite, kick, and tear every one within
reach; and when she found herself foiled in all those mischievous
attempts, she convulsively grasped the unpaved wet floor, and, in
imitation of the hyena, gave utterance to the most discordant
sounds. Manacled and shackled with leather thongs, she was now
partly dragged and partly carried to an open grassy spot; and there
under the starry vault of heaven, and in the presence of a
considerable number of people, the conjurer, in a businesslike
manner, began his exorcising art. The poor sufferer, as if
conscious of the dreaded old man’s<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_290">[290]</span> presence, struggled frantically to escape
his skill; but the latter, disregarding her entreaties and
lamentations, her fits of unnatural gaiety and bursts of thrilling
anguish, with one hand laid an amulet on her heaving bosom, whilst,
with the other, he made her smell a rag, in which the root of a
strong scented plant, a bone of a hyena, and some other abominable
unguents were bound up. The mad rage of the possessed woman being
instantaneously hushed by this operation, the conjurer addressed
himself to the <em>bouda</em> (evil spirit), and, in language not
fit for ears polite, requested him to give his name.” The demon is
always masculine, whatever may be the sex of the person possessed.
Question and answer followed, and finally the “conjurer” formally
exorcised the demon. “‘I command thee in the name of the Blessed
Trinity, the twelve apostles, and the three hundred and eighteen
bishops at the council of Nicaea, to leave this woman, and never
more to molest her.’</p>

<p>“The <em>bouda</em> did not feel disposed to obey the conjurer;
but on being threatened with a repast of glowing coals, which the
majority do not relish, he became docile, and in a sulky and
ventriloquizing tone of voice, promised to obey the request.</p>

<p>“Still anxious to delay his exit, he demanded something to eat;
and to my utter disgust, his taste was as coarse as the torments
inflicted on the young woman were ungallant. Filth and dirt of the
most revolting description, together with an admixture of water,
were the choice delicacies he selected for his supper. This strange
fare, which the most niggardly hospitality could not refuse,
several persons hastened to prepare, and when all was ready, and
the earthen dish had been hidden in the centre of a leafy shrub,
the conjurer said to the <em>bouda</em>, ‘As thy father did, so do
thou.’ These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span> words
had scarcely escaped the lips of the exorcist, when the possessed
person leaped up, and, crawling on all fours, sought the dainty
repast which she lapped with a sickening avidity and greediness.
She now laid hold of a stone, which three strong men could scarcely
lift, and raising it aloft in the air, whirled it madly round her
head for two seconds, and then fell senseless on the ground. In
half an hour she recovered, but was quite unconscious of what had
transpired.</p>

<p>“Three other women had similar attacks that same evening, and
that, too, without any premonitory symptoms. I tried to deceive
one, and instead of the disgusting concoction, put a wooden dish
with bread and water in her way; but on smelling it she shrank from
its contents, and rapidly crept on till the strong effluvia brought
her to the spot where the loathsome viands were concealed. . .
.</p>

<p>“Next in importance to the <em>bouda</em> is the <em>zar</em>.
This malady is exclusively confined to unmarried women, and has
this peculiar feature, that during the violence of the paroxysm it
prompts the patient to imitate the sharp discordant growl of the
leopard. I recollect that the first time I saw a case of this
description, it gave me a shock which made my blood run cold. The
sufferer was a handsome, gay, and lively girl, a little above
fifteen. In the morning she was engaged as usual in her work, when
a quarrel ensued between her and other domestics. The fierce
dispute, though of a trifling character, roused the passions of the
fiery Ethiopian to such a pitch that it brought on an hysterical
affection. The natives all cried, ‘She is possessed,’ and certainly
her ghastly smile, nervous tremor, wild stare, and unnatural howl,
justified the notion. To expel the <em>zar</em>, a conjurer, as in
the <em>bouda</em> complaint,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_292">[292]</span> was formerly considered indispensable; but
by dint of perseverance the medical faculty of the country, to
their infinite satisfaction, have at length made the happy
discovery that a sound application of the whip is quite as potent
an antidote against this evil as the necromancer’s spell.”<a id=
"FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class=
"fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>Parkyns said that he had seen “above a hundred” cases of
<em>bouda</em>. He alluded to the superstition with regard to
blacksmiths. “In Abyssinia their trade is hereditary, and
considered as more or less disgraceful, from the fact that
blacksmiths are, with very rare exceptions, believed to be all
sorcerers, and are opprobriously called <em>bouda</em>. . . .</p>

<p>“Few people will venture to molest or offend a blacksmith,
fearing the effects of his resentment. The greater part of the
‘possessed’ are women; and the reason of their being attacked is
often that they have despised the proffered love of some
<em>bouda</em>, or for other similar cause.</p>

<p>“It is a custom in Abyssinia to conceal the real name by which a
person is baptized, and to call him only by a sort of nickname,
which his mother gives him on leaving the church. . . . The reason
for the concealment of the Christian name is that the
<em>bouda</em> cannot act upon a person whose real name he does not
know. Should he, however, have obtained the true name of his
victim, he takes a particular kind of straw, and muttering
something over it, bends it into a circle, and places it under a
stone. The person thus doomed is taken ill at the very moment of
the bending of the straw; and should it by accident snap under the
operation, the result of the attack will be that the patient
dies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>“This malady and
the Tigritiya are no doubt often purposely counterfeited by
servant-maids to evade their work, and by others to excite pity,
attract attention, and get themselves pulled about by the men. . .
.</p>

<p>“The first case which I ever saw, and which I consequently
watched very attentively and noted down, was that of a
servant-woman at Rohabaita. The first day she complained of general
languor, and of a stupid heavy feeling about the head. Towards
evening this seemed to increase, when she cried a little, but was
perfectly reasonable, and excused herself by saying that it was
only because she felt low and melancholy. An hour after this,
however, she burst out into hysterical laughter, and complained of
violent pain in the stomach and bowels. It was at this stage that
the other servants began to suspect that she was under the
influence of the <em>bouda</em>. In a short time she became quiet,
and by degrees sank into a state of lethargy, approaching to
insensibility. Either from excellent acting and great fortitude, or
from real want of feeling, the various experiments which we made on
her seemed to have no more effect than they would have had on a
mesmeric somnambulist. We pinched her repeatedly; but pinch as hard
as we could, she never moved a muscle of her face, nor did she
otherwise express the least sensation. I held a bottle of strong
sal-volatile under her nose, and stopped her mouth, and this having
no effect, I steeped some rag in it and placed it in her nostrils;
but although I am sure that she had never either seen, smelt, or
heard of such a preparation as liquid ammonia, it had no more
effect on her than rosewater. She held her thumbs tightly bent
inside her hands, as if to prevent their being seen. On my
observing this to a bystander, he told me that the thumbs were the
<em>bouda’s</em> particular<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_294">[294]</span> perquisite, and that he would allow no
person to take them. Consequently, several persons tried to open
her hand and get at them; but she resisted with what appeared to me
wonderful strength for a girl, and bit their fingers till in more
than one instance she drew blood. I, among others, made the
attempt, and though I got a bite or two for my pains, yet either
the devil had great respect for me as an Englishman and a good
Christian, or she had for me as her master, for the biting was all
a sham, and struck me as more like kissing than anything else,
compared with the fearful wounds she had inflicted on the rest of
the party.</p>

<p>“I had a string of amulets which I usually wore, having on it
many charms for various maladies; but I was perfectly aware that
none for the <em>bouda</em> was among them. Still, hoping thereby
to expose the cheat, I asserted that there was a very celebrated
one, and laid the whole string on her face, expecting that she
would pretend to feel the effects, and act accordingly; but to my
surprise and disappointment, she remained quite motionless. Several
persons had been round the village to look for some talisman, but
only one was found. On its being applied to her mouth, she for an
instant sprang up, bit at it, and tore it, but then laughed, and
said it was weak, and would not vex <em>him</em>. . . . I deluged
her with bucketfuls of water, but could not even elicit from her a
start or a pant, an effect usually produced by water suddenly
dashed over a person. At night she could not sleep, but became more
restless, and spoke several times. She once remarked, in her
natural tone of voice, that she was not ill, nor attacked by the
<em>bouda</em>, but merely wished to return to Adoua. She said this
so naturally that I was completely taken off my guard, and told her
that of course she might go, but that she<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_295">[295]</span> must wait till the morrow. The other people
smiled, and whispered me that it was only a device of the
<em>bouda’s</em> to get her into the forest, and there devour
her.</p>

<p>“Singular coincidences not unfrequently occur in such a way as
to encourage superstitious persons in their credulity; and, strange
to say, that very night, for the first and last time that I ever
heard him during my stay at Rohabaita, the hyena kept howling and
laughing close to the village. . . .</p>

<p>“At night I ordered the people to close the door of the hut, and
lie across it, some inside and some out. These precautions,
however, did not satisfy them; and they insisted on having the
young woman bound hand and foot, as the only means of preventing
her escape. She lay pretty still, merely moaning, and occasionally
starting up when the hyena called. I was lying on a couch, she and
the other people on the floor. Determined to see the issue of the
affair, I watched her narrowly, and when the guard dropped off to
sleep, one by one, I pretended to do so likewise. She also was
perfectly still for near an hour, and I fancied that she too had
fallen asleep, when suddenly, the hyena calling close by, she, to
my astonishment, rose without her bonds, which I had seen, as I
imagined, securely fastened. She then crept on all-fours towards
the door, which she succeeded in partly opening. I was just going
to spring on her when one of the heavily sleeping guards made a
noise, which sounded something like a grunt or a snore, and it
appeared to me that she stifled a laugh. This led me to believe
more and more that she was shamming; but I said nothing, and she
returned of her own accord to her place. Although she did not sleep
during the whole night, yet she remained still as<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span> long as the people were quiet,
only moaning a little whenever any one, by yawning or otherwise,
showed signs of waking. Next day she appeared a little better, and
talked more rationally, but still very wildly, and would neither
eat nor drink. Once we allowed her to leave the hut for a moment,
on pretence of necessity, and she went quietly enough; but on her
return being delayed longer than we considered right, parties were
sent out in quest of her, and after a long search she was
discovered more than a mile from the hut, and making for the
thickest of the jungle.</p>

<p>“The second night was passed much as the former one; but the
following day we prevailed on her to take a little bread. On
swallowing a piece about the size of a nut she became very sick;
and a draught of water produced a similar result. A better night
seemed to do her good, for on the following day she managed to eat
a little, and by slow degrees recovered her health.</p>

<p>“Since this occurrence I have witnessed many hoaxes easy to
discover, but also many which I could never see through, although I
tried every method that my small stock of ingenuity could
invent.</p>

<p>“I remember once a poor weakly girl on whom I had tried several
false charms, but without her moving. She was lying, apparently
senseless, in the inner court of a house at Adoua, and numbers of
persons were passing to and fro to see her, when, suddenly starting
up, she screamed and struggled with so much strength, that, on
seizing her by the legs and shoulders, I and three other powerful
men could scarcely keep her down. A man near me said, ‘I am sure
some one has with him a strong charm; if so, let him produce it.’
All denied the fact; but just then a stranger entered from the
outer court, when she cried out, ‘Let me alone, and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span> I will speak.’ This man was an
Amhara soldier, perfectly unknown to all of us, but who, hearing
one of our people inquire for charms in a house where he was
drinking, had volunteered to try one which he wore, and which he
declared to be very potent. On placing the amulet near her, she
yelled and screamed horribly. The owner (addressing her as a woman)
said, ‘Will you declare yourself if I take it away?’ She howled
still more at this insult, as she called it, and said, ‘I am no
woman.’ The question was then repeated several times in the
masculine, but she invariably attempted to evade a direct answer,
till, as if worn out, she exclaimed, ‘I will tell all; only take it
far from me!’ It was accordingly removed to some distance from her,
and she immediately sank down as if exhausted.”</p>

<p>When the cure had made some progress, “the <em>bouda</em>,
anxious to delay his exit as long as possible, demanded food (as he
always does) before leaving her. A basin was fetched, in which was
put a quantity of any filth that could be found (of fowls, dogs,
etc.), and mixed up with a little water and some ashes. I took the
basin myself, and hid it where I was positive she could not see me
place it, and covered it up with some loose stones which were
heaped in the corner. The <em>bouda</em> was then told that his
supper was prepared, and the woman rose and crawled down the court
on all fours, smelling like a dog on either side, till, passing
into the yard where the basin was, she went straight up to it, and,
grubbing it out from the place where it was hidden, devoured its
abominable contents with the utmost greediness. The <em>bouda</em>
was then supposed to leave her, and she fell to the ground, as if
fainting. From this state she recovered her health in a few
days.</p>

<p>“I had forgotten to mention that one of the
principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span> symptoms
is a great longing for charcoal, of which the patient will eat any
quantity she can obtain. The first proof of the devil’s leaving her
is her allowing her thumbs to be taken hold of.”</p>

<p>On another occasion Parkyns, suspecting a hoax, concocted a
charm which was composed of two or three bits of dry bamboo roots
wrapped in a piece of paper, an old leaf or two, some pipe-ashes,
and a tuft of hair cut from the tail of his dog. Then “proceeding
to the place where the sufferer lay, I ordered a large-mouthed jar
to be filled with dry mules’ dung and lighted. When this had been
done, and the smoke began to rise in clouds, I put into it a small
quantity of my charm, with every appearance of caution and care,
which done, we seized the unfortunate victim, and with some
difficulty forced her head close to the jar’s mouth, and then
rolled a <em>quarry</em> (<em>shama</em>) round it and the jar, so
as at once to keep her fast, and prevent the escape of the smallest
quantity of smoke. As may be imagined, in a moment she began to
cough violently, and at last, being almost suffocated, cried out,
‘Let me off, for pity’s sake; I am not ill, but only shamming.’ I
solemnly asserted this to be only a device of the Evil One to get
away from the charm, and held on, till her cries for pity, for the
sake of the Virgin, of Oubi, etc., becoming more confused, and her
cough more violent, I feared lest she might suffer too much if kept
longer.</p>

<p>“That magic vessel was preserved in a conspicuous situation in
the hut where the women worked till I left the place; and I must
say that the attacks of <em>bouda</em> were less frequent after
this occurrence than before; though I still had occasional cases
where the sunken eye and vacant stare cheated me into tenderness
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span> heart, and I
refrained from the use of my singular but most efficacious
remedy.”</p>

<p>Parkyns has also given an account of a similar disorder called
<em>tigritiya</em>, which may be the same as the <em>zar</em>
mentioned by Stern, though from the description, it appears to be
more serious. The <em>tigritiya</em>, says Parkyns, is the near
relation of the <em>bouda</em>, “but generally a far more
disagreeable and dangerous devil than he. His dependents are
supposed to be found in great numbers in Godjam, which province,
indeed, is celebrated for sorcerers of all kinds. The first
symptoms usually are the gradual wasting away of the attacked
person, without any cause being apparent either to herself or her
relatives. At last, however, after dieting, and the ordinary
medicines have been unsuccessfully tried, it becomes a matter of
suspicion to her friends, who determine, on ascertaining, whether
or no she be afflicted with this devil. The first thing to be
observed is to feed her daintily and dress her neatly. As her
complaint and this treatment advance, she becomes peevish and
fretful, and is always longing for something or other. Whatever she
demands must be procured, else she will become sulky, and, covering
up her head, remain sometimes for days without eating or speaking.
Ornaments of all kinds require to be borrowed for her, often at
much trouble to her unfortunate relations; for she is rarely
satisfied unless she gets an assortment of those worn by both
sexes, even to the lion’s skin of a warrior; and these are
frequently almost impossible to procure. With some persons it is
necessary to have recourse to music before the real cause of their
complaint can be discovered. Drums and other musical instruments
are collected outside the chamber door, and the musicians suddenly
strike up all together, when the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_300">[300]</span> patient is not expecting it. If her illness
be of an ordinary kind, she will, of course, beg of them to desist,
but, if possessed, she will leap or fall from her couch to the
ground, and commence shrugging her shoulders and swinging her head
to and fro in time with the music; beginning with a slight
movement, but gradually increasing in pace as she appears to become
excited, till at last her motions are so violent that a spectator
is led to fear for the safety of her neck. It is truly wonderful to
see a sick person whom you have just beheld stretched on a bed, a
weak, emaciated bag of bones, apparently without strength to rise,
keeping up this very fatiguing motion with a velocity and power of
endurance that would be astonishing even in an ordinarily strong
person. On the music’s ceasing she rests, and then begins to speak,
telling <em>his</em> name (that is, the devil’s) and his family;
and it is usually after this that she demands the trinkets,
specifying each article that she requires, and making their
production the condition of her dancing again. She, as I before
said, generally contrives to name objects that are most difficult
to obtain, such as the silver-ornamented velvet worn only by great
war-chiefs; and much sorrow and trouble does this cause to her
relations, for she will not be persuaded to show any sign of
animation if a single article she has named be not forthcoming; and
on her dancing and singing is supposed chiefly to depend her chance
of recovery.</p>

<p>“The mode of ejecting the Old Gentleman from his temporary
possession is something similar to what we have already described.
After the patient has been induced to dance pretty frequently, it
is to be hoped that the devil is put into a tolerably good humour,
which desideratum can only be obtained by making
frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span> and polite
inquiries when he will be pleased to have music, and by promptly
procuring everything he may demand, by the mouth of the possessed,
whether it be food or wearing apparel. The auspicious moment
arriving, the friends of the sufferer inquire of her when he will
be disposed to quit his present residence and go to his own place.
The first time this question is ventured upon, the spirit generally
replies that he is not yet satisfied with the entertainment he has
received at their hands, and seizes the opportunity of demanding
something more. After a time, however, if things go on well, he
fixes a day for taking his leave, usually the seventh after the day
on which he makes his announcement. The happy time having arrived,
a large party is assembled in some wild spot in the country, and
there must be feasting, dancing, and music, as before, but, if
possible, carried on with more than usual spirit. The patient joins
in with the rest; and the devil, when satisfied, announces his
intention to depart. This he signifies through the medium of his
victim, who takes off her finery; then, bowing her head, she kisses
her hands in token of farewell, and starts off, running at a pace
which few men could equal. She cannot, however, keep it up for more
than from fifty to a hundred yards, when she falls to the ground
senseless. At this moment the spirit is supposed to have left her;
and lest he should find himself worse off outside than in, and,
changing his mind, return to her, five or six active young men are
prepared beforehand, and as soon as she starts they follow her,
and, coming up with her just as she is falling, place themselves in
threatening attitudes round her body, one holding a drawn sword,
another firing a charge of powder out of a matchlock, and a third
brandishing a lance. This is supposed to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_302">[302]</span> intimidate the fiend, and prevent his
return, should he be so disposed.</p>

<p>“The woman, who but a moment before was outdoing all the party,
both in the dance and in running, now lies stretched on the ground
helpless and emaciated, as if after a long illness. She faintly
calls for water, which is given her; and when a little restored,
she is asked her name, which she answers correctly; and as a
conclusive proof of her freedom from the power of the Evil One, she
is requested to repeat the formerly so much dreaded
words—‘<em>B’ism Ab, ou Weld, ou Menfus Kouddos</em>’ (in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost). A sheep or a
fowl is killed, broiled on the embers, and eaten with bread. The
patient’s friends partake of this food when the devil goes out of
her. The bones and remains of the meat are burned with fire, and
the fragments of the bread buried in the ground. These are so left
for the devil, that if he should come back to the place he may
remain and feed, and not go on and bother the woman. Thus is the
cure complete, though it often takes a considerable time to effect
it.”</p>

<p>The characteristics of the disease have been mentioned fully
because they seem to have some bearing on certain Biblical
episodes.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of <em>bouda</em>, recourse is had to a
very simple and direct method of cure. Parkyns wrote:—“Many
instances have been related to me, wherein the friends of the
possessed, having procured charms of sufficient power to force the
spirit to declare his name and residence, but not equal to turning
him out, went at once to the place indicated, and, seizing on the
blacksmith, brought him forcibly to their home, where, having fed
him well, he was commanded to quit his victim, and at the same time
his life was threatened, lances being<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_303">[303]</span> pointed at his breast.”<a id=
"FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class=
"fnanchor">[250]</a> It is not stated whether this procedure is
effective.</p>

<p>Mr. Wylde dismissed the demon lightly:—“The <em>bouda</em>, or
evil spirit, that attacks some of the young women, nearly always
ugly virgins or hysterical and plain-looking girls that men will
never notice, is to my mind the greatest fraud of all their
superstitions. Every one has written about it, and I am afraid that
they have drawn a good deal on their imagination, and the
missionaries who have visited the country have, perhaps, been quite
as bigoted as the people they have tried to describe. I believe
that these peculiar fits which the women have, when they do all
sorts of filthy things, are nothing more than hysteria; many women
even in civilized countries are not responsible for their actions
when suffering from these complaints, and people who are inclined
to believe in the miraculous take for granted what the ignorant
peasantry say. I have seen several young women suffering from the
‘<em>bouda</em>’ and a bucket of cold water that I have thrown over
them, and a good smacking from my servant, has soon sent the devil
away, and the only after effect has been that they have been sulky,
because they were not made much of.”<a id=
"FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class=
"fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Parkyns was not a missionary, and he was a shrewd and
levelheaded observer. His comments are to the point:—“To many of my
readers it will doubtless appear, and very naturally, that all
these symptoms are impostures resorted to by the pretended
sufferers as a means of procuring the borrowed finery, and enjoying
the gaieties and festivities which are considered as the means of
curing the disorder. This sounds very probable; and I cannot deny
that such is my own opinion,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_304">[304]</span> though there are still some points which
have rather puzzled me. First, as in the <em>bouda</em>, the
extraordinary talent for acting which they display, and then the
fact that the imposture has not been discovered and published
centuries ago, but that it is still believed by the very people
among whom it has so long been and still daily continues to be
practised. How is it possible that a woman, who in her youthful
days may have been guilty of such a hoax, should suffer herself to
be imposed upon and led into so much trouble and expense by her
children afterwards? And yet this is of common occurrence. From
this last remark let it not be supposed that young women are the
only sufferers; men and women of all ages are liable, though the
young of the fair sex are perhaps the most frequently
possessed.</p>

<p>“One of my servants, who, by the great anxiety he showed in
watching and tending the patients, was evidently convinced of the
truth of their sufferings, had himself been attacked many years
before, and assured me that after his recovery he had not the
slightest recollection of anything that had taken place while the
fit was on him, but that his friends had told him all about it. How
was it possible that this man, supposing his own illness to have
been feigned, could be cheated by the same means?</p>

<p>“Lastly, the most puzzling thing of all is when a person acts
sickness to such perfection that Azrael himself is deceived, and,
mistaking the feigned malady for a real one, finishes it by
seriously taking away the life of the shammer.</p>

<p>“The following case will illustrate what I mean. I had a servant
named Bairou, a youth of about nineteen, who, from having been
several years in the service of Europeans, had acquired a few of
their notions; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
among others, had learnt to ridicule the superstitions of his
countrymen. He had a sister who had been ill for several months,
and no one knew what her complaint was. At his request I went to
visit her more than once, but was unable to do anything for her.
The fact is, my doctoring is on a very limited scale; and, as even
the most eminent physicians agree that the greatest difficulty is
to ascertain what is really the matter with the patient, I stood
very little chance with Bairou’s sister, who complained of nothing,
and showed no marked signs of ailing except in entire prostration
of strength, and a rapid falling off of flesh. She gradually got
worse, till one day her brother came to me and requested me to lend
him my ornaments, and also to beg some more from my friends at the
camp. I asked whether he was going to be ‘arkee’ to some friend
about to marry; but he answered with a melancholy smile that he
wanted them for his sister; as, having tried everything else, their
friends had proposed to see if she were possessed, and he, though
not believing in such nonsense, was willing to allow them to try
the experiment, lest, if anything happened to her, they should
upbraid him afterwards for having caused her death by his obstinacy
and incredulity.</p>

<p>“I, of course, quite approved of his determination, and easily
succeeded in obtaining the articles required of me. She was dressed
up in the borrowed finery as she lay on the couch; and at a signal
the musicians outside commenced playing. At the first notes her
eyes began to brighten, and, raising herself up for the first time
during many days, she swayed her body to and fro for a few moments,
after the manner of one possessed; but, becoming quickly exhausted,
she sank back, saying, with a faint smile, ‘It is too late now!’
She repeated these words twice; they were the last I ever heard her
utter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span> Three hours
after she was a corpse. Was this, too, a sham? Or what may it be
called? Possibly some freak of her disordered imagination.”<a id=
"FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class=
"fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Stern had the tendency to moralize which prevailed at the time
when he wrote, but there can be little doubt that he offered a
sound opinion in the following passage:—“In bringing this
demoniacal subject to a close, I am forcibly reminded of the words,
‘Be sure your sin will find you out.’ That there is something in
these diseases and in their mode of cure which transcends ordinary
disorders no one who has stood beside a frantic and agonized
patient and wondered at the sudden and more than dramatic
transition from raving frenzy to childlike docility can well deny;
but without deciding whether it is epilepsy, catalepsy, or
hysteria, I am quite sure that fiends and spirits have less to do
with the matter than the irregular life and dissolute course which
so many pursue.”<a id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253"
class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>It would, indeed, be a matter for astonishment if marked nervous
affections did not occur in a country where, among the people of
both sexes, unwholesome diet and parasitical irritation so often
combine their results with those of sensual habits of body and mind
acquired early in life.</p>

<p>It has already been said that the Abyssinian soldier wears no
uniform, and is not easily distinguished by his appearance from the
civilian. But there is a distinct military class, with
characteristics of its own. “There is no harder worker,” said Mr.
Wylde, “than the Abyssinian peasant, and no more harmless and
hospitable person when left alone and properly treated<a id=
"FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class=
"fnanchor">[254]</a>; and no more truculent, worthless, conceited,
lazy, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span> useless
individual than the Abyssinian soldier, who formerly did nothing
but prey upon the defenceless cultivator. Circumstances are now
altering this, but before the country settles down to modern
civilization and makes any great strides forward, a civil
revolution must take place, which may not be far distant.”<a id=
"FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class=
"fnanchor">[255]</a> The same writer has pointed out that the
soldiery “were called into existence by Abyssinia being surrounded
by Mohammedan enemies, and little by little they increased and
multiplied till they got out of all proportion to the wants of a
peaceful country.” The king’s exchequer cannot provide pay for
these men, so, to keep them quiet, they are allowed to live by
exaction. Mr. Wylde’s strictures apply to the “lazy, loafing lot of
mercenaries who have never done anything in their lives except
fighting and looting, men without homes and without territory,
ready to fight for those who give the highest pay, and who do not
value the lives of their fellow-Christians at the price of a sheep
or a jar of hydromel;” and he adds, “I am writing only of the
mercenary soldier whose father and grandfather, perhaps, were the
same, and not of the bulk of the fighting force of the country, who
are yeomen farmers and their servants, or the peasants and their
families.”<a id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class=
"fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>The state of feeling between the peasantry and the soldiery
might have serious consequences if the Abyssinian monarch undertook
an important campaign outside his territory. “The great danger to
an unpopular king attempting such an expedition would be, in the
absence of the army, a rising of an oppressed peasantry, backed up
by some European Power, to put down the military party. The arming
of the peasantry and farmer class with modern weapons has not
altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span> been a
blessing to the present ruler, and may end not only in his
downfall, but in that of the barons as well.”<a id=
"FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class=
"fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>The fighting value of the Abyssinian army is by no means a
<i>quantité négligeable</i> in the politics of Eastern Africa, and
it would be very easy to underrate it. Mr. Wylde, in his narrative
of the battle of Adoua, has given a very complete account of the
numbers, armament and temper of the Negus’s forces, and he does not
agree with the estimate formed by Mansfield Parkyns of their
personal valour.<a id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258"
class="fnanchor">[258]</a> He has also described the tactics which
they customarily adopt in attacking, and has made some interesting
observations on the employment of artillery, mounted infantry, and
cavalry in the country.”<a id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>The limitations to the activity of the forces are chiefly
determined by commissariat difficulties. “The Abyssinian hordes are
the same as the locust, they live on what they can get from the
surrounding country; and when they have devoured everything, they
have to move on to another place where supplies are procurable. At
the outside an Abyssinian who is not one of the regular soldiers
can keep the field for a couple of months, and then he has to take
one transport animal with him, with a boy or girl, generally the
latter, to look after his riding animal and to cook his food. The
regular troops are the same; they have to bring supplies with them,
which they get from their leaders before they set out on the
campaign; after these are finished, unless fresh supplies come
forward, they have to live on the country.”<a id=
"FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class=
"fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>Probably the
most recently published paper dealing with the Abyssinian army is
the despatch, dated June 2, 1904, of Colonel Rochfort, C.B., R.A.,
included in the official account of the operations in
Somaliland.<a id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class=
"fnanchor">[261]</a> Colonel Rochfort accompanied the forces which
his Majesty Menelek II., on the invitation of the British
Government, sent in 1903, “to intercept the Mullah’s retreat,
should he attempt to escape to the south or west.” As might be
imagined from the nature of the document, it contains no
descriptive account of the Abyssinian Expedition, and very little
critical comment upon it. But the following particulars may serve
to convey some idea of Abyssinian operations in the field at the
present time. The strength of the force first employed was about
five thousand men, nearly all of whom were mounted on mules. It
left Harrar for its destination (the Webi Shebeli, near Hilowen) on
February 18, 1903, under the command of Fituari Gabri.</p>

<p>Surprise parties were sent out to visit all wells within reach
to the north, and “the Abyssinians carried out these raids with
considerable dash and some success, showing their mobility by the
ease with which they covered long distances, sometimes a hundred
miles in forty-eight hours; but as at this time they had no special
arrangements for carrying water, their scope was necessarily
restricted.</p>

<p>“During these operations the main body was attacked by a
considerable number of Dervishes. The attack was delivered in thick
bush on the arrival of the force in bivouac, and before the zareba
was formed; it was pushed home with resolution, but repulsed with
loss. The pursuit was carried out with vigour, and the Dervish
casualties were estimated at three hundred. The<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span> Abyssinians returned their
loss at thirty-one killed and wounded. The Abyssinians were now
living on the country, and exigencies of supply rendered it
necessary to move down stream to Mekunna. . . .</p>

<p>“On the morning of May 28 the Abyssinians left Hahi, and after a
series of forced marches surprised the Habr Suliman section of the
Bagheri tribe on the morning of May 31 at Jeyd, which is thirty
miles south of Bur. The Dervishes suffered heavy losses, and all
their camels and stock were captured. . . . This terminated the
first phase of the operations, and the force returned to
Harrar.”</p>

<p>Later, the Negus consented to send another expedition, and
“expressed the wish for an increase in the number of medical
officers to accompany his force, and also suggested the issue of
water-bottles to his men. At the conclusion of the first phase of
the operations I had represented to the War Office that the absence
of any special arrangements for carrying water had seriously
affected the mobility of the Abyssinians; this want was now
remedied by the issue of one thousand twelve-gallon tanks; pumps
and waterproof sheets for improvising drinking-troughs were also
supplied by his Majesty’s Government.</p>

<p>“There is no organized system of supply in the Abyssinian army,
and hitherto arrangements made individually to carry one month’s
supply on a mule or donkey had been found sufficient to enable
expeditions to reach a district from which supplies could be drawn;
such a course did not meet the conditions under which the present
force was about to act, owing to the distance to be covered, the
necessity for carrying water, and the total absence of any grain,
either on the road or in the probable zone of operations. After
some unavoidable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
delay, arrangements were improvised for carrying two months’
supply,<a id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class=
"fnanchor">[262]</a> and his Highness Ras Makunnan,<a id=
"FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class=
"fnanchor">[263]</a> who personally interested himself in the
despatch of the force, subsequently supplemented this supply by
sending three small convoys as transport became available. The
force commenced concentration in the neighbourhood of Harrar on
November 27, 1903. . . . The advanced party reached Wardair on
January 12, 1904. . . . The resources of the country in the
neighbourhood of the River Fafan and the arrival of two more small
convoys enabled the force to keep the field until March 28, 1904,
when the Abyssinian commander (Fituari Gabri) was advised that the
retreat of the Mullah through the Sorl, pursued by the British
columns, rendered the presence of the Abyssinian expedition no
longer necessary, and the force marched for Harrar.”<a id=
"FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class=
"fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>Those who wish to acquaint themselves with the home life of the
Abyssinian people should read the works of Mansfield Parkyns and
Mr. Augustus Wylde. The latter has given especially full details of
the surroundings and habits of the middle and lower classes of the
nation.</p>

<p>Mr. Wylde has chapters on “Shooting in Abyssinia” and “Outfit
and Rifles.” His book also contains an appendix on “Animals met
with in Abyssinia and on the Borders,” ranging in its scope from
lions to sand-martins. There are several passages dealing with
sport and natural history in Parkyns’s volume, and Mr. Vivian’s
work contains observations on the same subjects.</p>

<p>Stecker’s scientific notes have been frequently<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span> mentioned. His brief but pithy
treatise amply repays study. Harris’s “Highlands of Ethiopia” has
valuable appendices on the climate, geology, botany, and zoology of
the southern provinces (Vol. II).</p>

<p>Probably no country at the present time offers a better field
for research, sport, and exploration than Abyssinia.</p>

priests and deacons is, I believe, tolerably simple; for instance,
I have been told that, on the arrival of the present Abouna from
Egypt, the candidates, who are only required to be able to read a
little, were collected in a mass near the place where he was. The
bishop then went through some ceremony, and ended by pronouncing a
blessing, and blowing in the direction of the assembled crowd, who
were thus all ordained. Among these was a woman with her child in
her arms, who had come thither from motives of curiosity. She, too,
was of course ordained; but I don’t remember hearing that she ever
officiated. If a priest be married previous to his ordination, he
is allowed to remain so; but no one can marry after having entered
the priesthood.” (“Life in Abyssinia,” p. 294.)</p>

the ruins and other traces of an early and extinct civilization
which it contains. These have been the occasion of much speculation
among archæologists. An account of the obelisks and other remains
was given by Bruce; Mr. Wylde has made some interesting comments on
the subject in his chapter on Axum; many writers on Abyssinia have
referred to it at some length; and the late Mr. Theodore Bent dealt
with the antiquities of the place in “The Sacred City of the
Ethiopians” (Longmans, Green and Co., 1893).</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span><a id=
"app2"></a>APPENDIX</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Abyssinia</span> is a deeply
interesting country from the point of view of geographical
distribution, and it is much to be regretted that Dr. A. J. Hayes
did not have the opportunity of collecting insects on a large
scale. The animals of the southern half of Arabia are Ethiopian in
character; but in the Abyssinian mountains we may expect to find,
and we do find, a certain amount of Oriental affinity.</p>

<p>The valuable little collection of insects made by Dr. Hayes has
been presented by him to the Hope Department of the Oxford
University Museum, where the specimens can be seen and studied by
every naturalist interested in the great problems of distribution.
The attention of the donor was directed to the Oxford Museum by Mr.
W. L. S. Loat, who has himself contributed a large amount of
valuable material. Dr. Hayes’ collection was made, in February
1903, in the vicinity of Lake Tsana, at a height of about 6500
feet. A complete list is furnished below. Dr. Dixey has kindly
determined and made remarks upon the <i>Pierinae</i>.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, Dr. Hayes presented three insects
captured by him at Gedaref in the Soudan, including a pair of a
magnificent new species of Buprestid beetle of the genus
<i>Sternocera</i>, taken <i>in coitu</i>. This species has recently
been described, from Dr. Hayes’ specimen and two others in the
British Museum, by Mr. C. O. Waterhouse, who has given it the name
<i>Sternocera druryi</i> (“Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.” Oct., 1904, p.
247). The third insect is an example of a Cantharid beetle, which
does great damage to the crops at Gadarif. Its determination as
<i>Mylabris hybrida</i> (Bohem.) is therefore a matter of some
importance.</p>
